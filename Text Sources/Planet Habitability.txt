What are the limits of “habitability”

The actual limits of habitability in the Universe are unknown 

And surely unknowable 

Unless et-life visits or sends messages: 
we will never know about life outside our local stellar neighborhood

Future knowledge about life
is probably limited to life around
the nearest few thousand stars



Planet Making Machine

Planets are a diverse set of bodies 
that have complex evolutionary processes



Habitability - best estimates

Necessarily based on Earth-life

Habitability issues usually focus on 
environmental requirements that  

that plausibly might support life that is 
analogous to Earth life



Standard habitability needs

Animals  (multi-cellular air-breathing)

• Restricted environmental needs
0<T<50 ºC

• Not well adapted to change
• Species short-lived - easy to extinct 
• Need oxygen
• Took 2.2 by to have O2 in atmosphere
• Took ~ 4 billion years for animals to become 
abundant in the fossil record

•Difficult to evolve?



Standard habitability needs
Microbial organisms

• Less restricted environmental needs 

-15ºC<T<122 ºC (probably much higher)

• Specific organisms adapted to extreme environments

• Very difficult to extinct, species may last billions of years

• Microscopic, numerous, can remain dormant for long times

• Appear early in Earth history >3.5 AE, easy to evolve?

• Most common life on Earth

• Probably the most common life in the Universe



Habitability of  planets involves many 
potential factors

• Planet mass
• Planet C, H20 & K content
• Continent/ocean ratio
• Salinity
• Solar, stellar activity
• Planet history
• Magnetic field
• Orbital stability and eccentricity
• Spin rate, obliquity



Water

a fundamental need for life (as we know it)

• Surface water - sets restricted environmental 
limits

• Sub-surface water- wide range of 
occurrences probably in Pluto, certainly in 
Europa, apparently in 500 km Enceladus, in 
many asteroids for millions of years. Interiors 
warmed by accretional heat, radiogenic and 
tidal heat. 



Habitable Zone Concept
An increasingly used & increasingly loosely used concept

The range of distances around a central star 
at which Earth-like planets maintain conditions 
sufficient for the existence of life at the surface. 

First publications: 

Huang (1959, 1960), Dole (1964), Shklovski & Sagan (1966)



Most Common Habitable Zone Concept

The range of distances 
from a star where an Earth-like planet

can have surface water (oceans!)

Too close to star - oceans lost to space 
(~.95AU for Sun)

Too far from star - oceans 
freeze

( ~when CO2 ice clouds 
form)

273 K at 1 AU

(CO2 free atmosphere )             Selsis et al.  2007



The rapid rise of surface temperature 
Is due to increased water vapor

with atm

no atm

Increased water vapor- more greenhouse
more Raleigh backscatter



Inner edge of the HZ

Extreme inner edge

Runaway greenhouse (4 ) emission threshold ~300 Wm-2

(“solar constant” =  1360 wm-2)

In a runaway -- positive feedback due to water vapor
Greenhouse drives the surface temperature 
> the critical point of water






For Earth & Sun
Occurs when 
Seff >1.4



A lesson from Venus

High D/H  (100X Earth)- consistent with ocean loss 

Loss occurred >1by ago when Sun was >8% fainter

This implies an evidence-based estimate  of the 
HZ inner edge of 0.75AU






Moist Greenhouse

• Begins ~ 0.95 AU,    Ts ~ 340K

• Hi water vapor abundance >20%

• Tropopause lifts

• Stratospheric PH2O increases

• Tropopause “cold- trap” ceases to limit water 
loss 

• H2O photolyzed- H is lost to space

• Depletes ocean <109 yrs

Earth’s ocean-free 
future



Outer edge of the HZ

Formation of CO2 clouds leads to “Snowball Earth”

Ts > 273 K to prevent ice-albedo positive feedback
(when ice cap reaches a critical latitude 
increased albedo causes global freeze-over) 

Estimates
1.37 AU for CO2 cloud formation
1.67 AU max greenhouse for cloud-free Earth
2.4 AU optimized warming by CO2 clouds
