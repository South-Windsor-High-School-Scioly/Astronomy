Radial velocity
The radial velocity or line-of-sight velocity of a target with
respect to an observer is the rate of change of the vector
displacement between the two points. It is formulated as the vector
projection of the target-observer relative velocity onto the relative
direction or line-of-sight (LOS) connecting the two points.

The radial speed or range rate is the temporal rate of the distance
or range between the two points. It is a signed scalar quantity, A plane flying past a radar station:
formulated as the scalar projection of the relative velocity vector the plane's velocity vector (red) is
onto the LOS direction. Equivalently, radial speed equals the norm the sum of the radial velocity (green)

of the radial velocity, modulo the sign.[a] and the tangential velocity (blue).

In astronomy, the point is usually taken to be the observer on
Earth, so the radial velocity then denotes the speed with which the object moves away from the Earth (or
approaches it, for a negative radial velocity).

Formulation
Given a differentiable vector  defining the instantaneous relative position of a target with respect
to an observer.

Let the instantaneous relative velocity of the target with respect to the observer be

(1)

The magnitude of the position vector  is defined as in terms of the inner product

(2)
The quantity range rate is the time derivative of the magnitude (norm) of , expressed as

(3)

Substituting (2) into (3)

Evaluating the derivative of the right-hand-side by the chain rule



using (1) the expression becomes

By reciprocity,[1] . Defining the unit relative position vector  (or LOS direction),
the range rate is simply expressed as

i.e., the projection of the relative velocity vector onto the LOS direction.

Further defining the velocity direction , with the relative speed , we have:

where the inner product is either +1 or -1, for parallel and antiparallel vectors, respectively.

A singularity exists for coincident observer target, i.e., ; in this case, range rate is undefined.

Applications in astronomy
In astronomy, radial velocity is often measured to the first order of approximation by Doppler
spectroscopy. The quantity obtained by this method may be called the barycentric radial-velocity
measure or spectroscopic radial velocity.[2] However, due to relativistic and cosmological effects over the
great distances that light typically travels to reach the observer from an astronomical object, this measure
cannot be accurately transformed to a geometric radial velocity without additional assumptions about the
object and the space between it and the observer.[3] By contrast, astrometric radial velocity is determined
by astrometric observations (for example, a secular change in the annual parallax).[3][4][5]

Spectroscopic radial velocity
Light from an object with a substantial relative radial velocity at emission will be subject to the Doppler
effect, so the frequency of the light decreases for objects that were receding (redshift) and increases for
objects that were approaching (blueshift).

The radial velocity of a star or other luminous distant objects can be measured accurately by taking a
high-resolution spectrum and comparing the measured wavelengths of known spectral lines to
wavelengths from laboratory measurements. A positive radial velocity indicates the distance between the
objects is or was increasing; a negative radial velocity indicates the distance between the source and
observer is or was decreasing.



William Huggins ventured in 1868 to estimate the radial velocity of Sirius with respect to the Sun, based
on observed redshift of the star's light.[6]

In many binary stars, the orbital motion usually causes radial velocity
variations of several kilometres per second (km/s). As the spectra of
these stars vary due to the Doppler effect, they are called
spectroscopic binaries. Radial velocity can be used to estimate the
ratio of the masses of the stars, and some orbital elements, such as
eccentricity and semimajor axis. The same method has also been used
to detect planets around stars, in the way that the movement's
measurement determines the planet's orbital period, while the
resulting radial-velocity amplitude allows the calculation of the lower
bound on a planet's mass using the binary mass function. Radial
velocity methods alone may only reveal a lower bound, since a large Diagram showing how an
planet orbiting at a very high angle to the line of sight will perturb its exoplanet's orbit changes the
star radially as much as a much smaller planet with an orbital plane position and velocity of a star as

on the line of sight. It has been suggested that planets with high they orbit a common center of
mass

eccentricities calculated by this method may in fact be two-planet
systems of circular or near-circular resonant orbit.[7][8]

Detection of exoplanets
The radial velocity method to detect exoplanets is based on the
detection of variations in the velocity of the central star, due to the
changing direction of the gravitational pull from an (unseen)
exoplanet as it orbits the star. When the star moves towards us, its
spectrum is blueshifted, while it is redshifted when it moves away
from us. By regularly looking at the spectrum of a star—and so,
measuring its velocity—it can be determined if it moves
periodically due to the influence of an exoplanet companion.

Data reduction
From the instrumental perspective, velocities are measured
relative to the telescope's motion. So an important first step of the data reduction is to remove the
contributions of

the Earth's elliptic motion around the Sun at approximately ± 30 km/s,
a monthly rotation of ± 13 m/s of the Earth around the center of gravity of the Earth-Moon
system,[9]

the daily rotation of the telescope with the Earth crust around the Earth axis, which is up to
±460 m/s at the equator and proportional to the cosine of the telescope's geographic
latitude,
small contributions from the Earth polar motion at the level of mm/s,
contributions of 230 km/s from the motion around the Galactic Center and associated proper
motions.[10]

in the case of spectroscopic measurements corrections of the order of ±20 cm/s with
respect to aberration.[11]



Sin i degeneracy is the impact caused by not being in the plane of the motion.

Notes
a. The norm, a nonnegative number, is multiplied by -1 if velocity (red arrow in the figure) and

relative position form an obtuse angle or if relative velocity (green arrow) and relative
position are antiparallel.
