2M1207,
2M1207A
or
2MASS
J12073346–3932539 is a brown dwarf
located in the constellation Centaurus; a
companion object, 2M1207b, may be the
first extrasolar planetary-mass companion
to be directly imaged, and is the first
discovered orbiting a brown dwarf.[5][6]
2M1207 was discovered during the course
of the 2MASS infrared sky survey: hence
the "2M" in its name, followed by its
celestial coordinates. With a fairly early (for
a brown dwarf) spectral type of M8,[1] it is
very young, and probably a member of the
TW Hydrae association. Its estimated mass
is around 25 Jupiter masses.[4] The
companion, 2M1207b, is estimated to have
a mass of 5–6 Jupiter masses.[7] Still
glowing red hot, it will shrink to a size
slightly smaller than Jupiter as it cools over
the next few billion years.
An initial photometric estimate for the
distance to 2M1207 was 70 parsecs.[4] In
December 2005, American astronomer Eric
Mamajek reported a more accurate
distance (53 ± 6 parsecs) to 2M1207 using
the moving cluster method.[8] The new
distance gives a fainter luminosity for
2M1207. Recent trigonometric parallax
results have confirmed this moving cluster
distance, leading to a distance estimate of
53 ± 1 parsec or 172 ± 3 light years.[4]

Planetary system
Like classical T Tauri stars, many brown
dwarfs are surrounded by disks of gas and
dust which accrete onto the brown dwarf.
[9][10] 2M1207 was first suspected to have
such a disk because of its broad Hα line.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AB_Aurigae

AB Aurigae
AB Aurigae is a young Herbig Ae star[3] in the
Auriga constellation. It is located at a distance of
approximately 531 light years from the Sun based
on stellar parallax.[1] This pre-main-sequence star
has a stellar classification of A0Ve,[4] matching an
A-type main-sequence star with emission lines in
the spectrum. It has 2.4 times the mass of the Sun
and is radiating 38[8] times the Sun's luminosity
from its photosphere at an effective temperature of
9,772 K.[10] The radio emission from the system
suggests the presence of a thermal jet originating
from the star with a velocity of 300 km s−1. This is
causing
an
estimated
mass
loss
of
1.7 × 10−8 M☉ yr−1.[8]
This star is known for hosting a dust disk that may
harbour a condensing planet or brown dwarf. The
star could host a possible substellar companion in
wide orbit. The star is part of the young TaurusAuriga association,[4] which is located in the
Taurus Molecular Cloud.[12] The star itself may
recently have encountered a dense cloudlet, which
disrupted its debris disk and produced an
additional reflection nebula.[13]

In 2017 scientists used the Atacama Large
Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) to take
an image of the protoplanetary disk around AB
Aurigae. The image showed a dusty disk which has
a radius of about 120 astronomical units and a
distinct "gap". Inside this gap gaseous spiral arms
are detected in CO.[14][3]

Oppenheimer et al. (2008)[15] observed an
annulus feature in AB Aurigae's dust disk between
43 and 302 AU from the star, a region never seen
before. An azimuthal gap in an annulus of dust at a
radius of 102 AU would suggest the formation of at
least one small body at an orbital distance of
nearly 100 AU. Such an object could turn out to be

either a massive planetary companion or more
likely a brown dwarf companion, in both cases
located at nearly 100 AU from the bright star. So
far the object is unconfirmed.
Observations with ALMA found two gaseous spiral
arms inside the disk. These are best explained by
an unseen planet with a semimajor axis of about
60–80 au. An additional planet with a semimajor
axis of 30 au and with a large pitch angle
compared to the disk (likely higher inclination)
could explain the emptiness of the inner dusty
disk.[3] The outer planet was still not detected as in
2022, putting an upper limit on is mass at 3–4 MJ,
inconsistent with the spiral structures observed in
the disk.[16] The planet-like clump observed in
April 2022 at projected separation 93 AU from
star, may be either an accretion disk around newly
formed planet or the unstable disk region
currently transforming into the planet.[17] The
planet observation was confirmed in July 2022.[18]

Beta Pictoris - Wikipedia

1 of 16

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_Pictoris

Beta Pictoris
Beta Pictoris (abbreviated β Pictoris or β Pic)
is the second brightest star in the constellation
Pictor. It is located 63.4 light-years (19.4 pc) from
the Solar System, and is 1.75 times as massive and
8.7 times as luminous as the Sun. The Beta
Pictoris system is very young, only 20 to 26
million years old,[12] although it is already in the
main sequence stage of its evolution.[8] Beta
Pictoris is the title member of the Beta Pictoris
moving group, an association of young stars which
share the same motion through space and have
the same age.[13]
The European Southern Observatory (ESO) has
confirmed the presence of two planets, Beta
Pictoris b,[14] and Beta Pictoris c,[15] through the
use of direct imagery. Both planets are orbiting in
the plane of the debris disk surrounding the star.
Beta Pictoris c is currently the closest extrasolar
planet to its star ever photographed: the observed
separation is roughly the same as the distance
between the asteroid belt and the Sun.[15]
Beta Pictoris shows an excess of infrared
emission[16] compared to normal stars of its type,
which is caused by large quantities of dust and gas
(including carbon monoxide)[17][18] near the star.
Detailed observations reveal a large disk of dust
and gas orbiting the star, which was the first
debris disk to be imaged around another star.[19]
In addition to the presence of several planetesimal
belts[20] and cometary activity,[21] there are
indications that planets have formed within this
disk and that the processes of planet formation
may be ongoing.[22] Material from the Beta
Pictoris debris disk is thought to be the dominant
source of interstellar meteoroids in the Solar
System.[23]

Beta Pictoris is a star in the southern constellation
of Pictor, the Easel, and is located to the west of
the bright star Canopus.[24] It traditionally
marked the sounding line of the ship Argo Navis,
before the constellation was split.[25] The star has
an apparent visual magnitude of 3.861,[1] so is
visible to the naked eye under good conditions,
though light pollution may result in stars dimmer
than magnitude 3 being too dim to see. It is the
second brightest in its constellation, exceeded only
by Alpha Pictoris, which has an apparent
magnitude of 3.30.[26]
The distance to Beta Pictoris and many other stars
was measured by the Hipparcos satellite. This was
done by measuring its trigonometric parallax: the
slight displacement in its position observed as the
Earth moves around the Sun. Beta Pictoris was
found to exhibit a parallax of 51.87
milliarcseconds,[27] a value which was later
revised to 51.44 milliarcseconds when the data
was reanalyzed taking systematic errors more
carefully into account.[6] The distance to Beta
Pictoris is therefore 63.4 light years, with an
uncertainty of 0.1 light years.[28][note 1]

The Hipparcos satellite also measured the proper
motion of Beta Pictoris: it is traveling eastwards at
a rate of 4.65 milliarcseconds per year, and
northwards at a rate of 83.10 milliarcseconds per
year.[6] Measurements of the Doppler shift of the star's
spectrum reveals it is moving away from Earth at a rate of
20 km/s.[5] Several other stars share the same motion through
space as Beta Pictoris and likely formed from the same gas
cloud at roughly the same time: these comprise the Beta
Pictoris moving group.[13]

Physical properties

This video sequence is based on an
artist's impression of exocomets
orbiting the star Beta Pictoris.

Spectrum, luminosity and variability
According to measurements made as part of the Nearby Stars Project, Beta Pictoris has a spectral
type of A6V[2] and has an effective temperature of 8,052 K (7,779 °C; 14,034 °F),[2] which is hotter
than the Sun's 5,778 K (5,505 °C; 9,941 °F).[29] Analysis of the spectrum reveals that the star
contains a slightly higher ratio of heavy elements, which are termed metals in astronomy, to
hydrogen than the Sun. This value is expressed as the quantity [M/H], the base-10 logarithm of the
ratio of the star's metal fraction to that of the Sun. In the case of Beta Pictoris, the value of [M/H] is

11/15/2023, 8:11 PM

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_Pictoris

0.05,[2] which means that the star's metal fraction is 12%
greater than that of the Sun.[note 3]
Analysis of the spectrum can also reveal the surface gravity of
the star. This is usually expressed as log g, the base-10
logarithm of the gravitational acceleration given in CGS units,
in this case, cm/s². Beta Pictoris has log g=4.15,[2] implying a
surface gravity of 140 m/s², which is about half of the
gravitational acceleration at the surface of the Sun
(274 m/s²).[29]

Artist's impression of the planet
Beta Pictoris b[note 2]

As an A-type main sequence star, Beta Pictoris is more
luminous than the Sun: combining the apparent magnitude of 3.861 with the distance of 19.44
parsecs gives an absolute magnitude of 2.4,[7] as compared to the Sun, which has an absolute
magnitude of 4.83.[29] This corresponds to a visual luminosity 9.2 times greater than that of the
Sun.[note 4] When the entire spectrum of radiation from Beta Pictoris and the Sun is taken into
account, Beta Pictoris is found to be 8.7 times more luminous than the Sun.[8][30]
Many main sequence stars of spectral type A fall into a region of the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram
called the instability strip, which is occupied by pulsating variable stars. In 2003, photometric
monitoring of the star revealed variations in brightness of around 1–2 millimagnitudes on
frequencies between about 30 and 40 minutes.[4] Radial velocity studies of Beta Pictoris also reveal
variability: there are pulsations at two frequencies, one at 30.4 minutes and one at 36.9
minutes.[31] As a result, the star is classified as a Delta Scuti variable.

Mass, radius and rotation
The mass of Beta Pictoris has been determined by using models of stellar evolution and fitting
them to the star's observed properties. This method yields a stellar mass between 1.7 and 1.8 solar
masses.[8] The star's angular diameter has been measured using interferometry with the Very
Large Telescope and was found to be 0.84 milliarcseconds.[9] Combining this value with the
distance of 63.4 light years gives a radius 1.8 times that of the Sun.[note 5]
The rotational velocity of Beta Pictoris has been measured to be at least 130 km/s.[11] Since this
value is derived by measuring radial velocities, this is a lower limit on the true rotational velocity:
the quantity measured is actually v sin(i), where i represents the inclination of the star's axis of
rotation to the line-of-sight. If it is assumed that Beta Pictoris is viewed from Earth in its equatorial
plane, a reasonable assumption since the circumstellar disk is seen edge-on, the rotation period
can be calculated as approximately 16 hours, which is significantly shorter than that of the Sun
(609.12 hours[29]).[note 6]

Age and formation
The presence of significant amounts of dust around the star[32] implies a young age of the system
and led to debate about whether it had joined the main sequence or was still a pre–main sequence
star[33] However, when the star's distance was measured by Hipparcos it was revealed that Beta
Pictoris was located further away than previously thought and hence was more luminous than
originally believed. Once the Hipparcos results were taken into account, it was found that Beta

11/15/2023, 8:11 PM

Pictoris was located close to the zero age main sequence and
was not a pre–main sequence star after all.[8] Analysis of Beta
Pictoris and other stars within the Beta Pictoris moving group
suggested that they are around 12 million years old.[13]
However more recent studies indicate that the age is roughly
double this at 20 to 26 million years old.[34][12]
Beta Pictoris may have been formed near the Scorpius–
Artist's impression of Beta
Centaurus association.[35] The collapse of the gas cloud which
Pictoris[note 7]
resulted in the formation of Beta Pictoris may have been
triggered by the shock wave from a supernova explosion: the
star which went supernova may have been a former companion of HD 83058, which is now a
runaway star. Tracing the path of HIP 46950 backwards suggests that it would have been in the
vicinity of the Scorpius–Centaurus association about 13 million years ago.[35] However, HD 83058
has been found to be a spectroscopic binary and unlikely to have been ejected by the supernova
explosion of a close companion, so the simple explanation for the origin of the Beta Pictoris cluster
is in doubt.[36]

secondary debris disks

Excess infrared radiation from Beta Pictoris was
detected by the IRAS[37] spacecraft in 1983.[32] Along
with Vega, Fomalhaut and Epsilon Eridani, it was one of the first four stars from which such an
excess was detected: these stars are called "Vega-like" after the first such star discovered. Since
A-type stars like Beta Pictoris tend to radiate most of their energy at the blue end of the
spectrum,[note 8] this implied the presence of cool matter in orbit around the star, which would
radiate at infrared wavelengths and produce the excess.[32] This hypothesis was verified in 1984
when Beta Pictoris became the first star to have its circumstellar disk imaged optically.[19] The
IRAS data are (at the micron wavelengths): [12]=2.68, [25]=0.05, [60]=−2.74 and [100]=−3.41.
The colour excesses are: E12=0.69, E25=3.35, E60=6.17 and E100=6.90.[16]
The debris disk around Beta Pictoris is seen edge-on by observers on Earth, and is orientated in a
northeast-southwest direction. The disk is asymmetric: in the northeast direction it has been
observed out to 1835 astronomical units from the star, while the southwest direction the extent is
1450 AU.[38] The disk is rotating: the part to the northeast of the star is moving away from Earth,

while the part to the southwest of the disc is moving towards Earth.[39]
Several elliptical rings of material have been observed in the outer regions of the debris disk
between 500 and 800 AU: these may have formed as a result of the system being disrupted by a
passing star.[40] Astrometric data from the Hipparcos mission reveal that the red giant star Beta
Columbae passed within 2 light years of Beta Pictoris about 110,000 years ago, but a larger
perturbation would have been caused by Zeta Doradus, which passed at a distance of 3 light years
about 350,000 years ago.[41] However computer simulations favor a lower encounter velocity than
either of these two candidates, which suggest that the star responsible for the rings may have been
a companion star of Beta Pictoris on an unstable orbit. The simulations suggest a perturbing star
with a mass of 0.5 solar masses is likely to blame for the structures. Such a star would be a red
dwarf of spectral type M0V.[38][42]
In 2006, imaging of the system with
the
Hubble
Space
Telescope's
Advanced Camera for Surveys
revealed the presence of a secondary
dust disk inclined at an angle of about
5° to the main disk and extending at
least 130 AU from the star.[43] The
secondary disk is asymmetrical: the
southwest extension is more curved
and less inclined than the northeast.
The imaging was not good enough to
distinguish between the main and
secondary disks within 80 AU of Beta
Pictoris, however the northeast
extension of the dust disk is predicted
Various planet formation processes, including exocomets and
to intersect with the main disk at
other planetesimals, around Beta Pictoris, a very young type A V
about 30 AU from the star.[43] The
star (NASA artist's conception)
secondary disk may be produced by a
massive planet in an inclined orbit
removing matter from the primary disk and causing it to move in an orbit aligned with the
planet.[44]
Studies made with the NASA Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer have discovered that the disk
around Beta Pictoris contains an extreme overabundance of carbon-rich gas.[45] This helps
stabilize the disk against radiation pressure which would otherwise blow the material away into
interstellar space.[45] Currently, there are two suggested explanations for the origin of the carbon
overabundance. Beta Pictoris might be in the process of forming exotic carbon-rich planets, in
contrast to the terrestrial planets in the Solar System, which are rich in oxygen instead of
carbon.[46] Alternatively it may be passing through an unknown phase that might also have
occurred early in the development of the Solar System: in the Solar System there are carbon-rich
meteorites known as enstatite chondrites, which may have formed in a carbon-rich environment. It
has also been proposed that Jupiter may have formed around a carbon-rich core.[46]
In 2011 the disk around Beta Pictoris became the first other planetary system to be photographed
by an amateur astronomer. Rolf Olsen of New Zealand captured the disk with a 10-inch Newtonian
reflector and a modified webcam.[47]

Planetesimal belts
In 2003, imaging of the inner region of the Beta Pictoris system
with the Keck II telescope revealed the presence of several
features which are interpreted as being belts or rings of
material. Belts at approximately 14, 28, 52 and 82 astronomical
units from the star were detected, which alternate in inclination
with respect to the main disk.[20]
Observations in 2004 revealed the presence of an inner belt
containing silicate material at a distance of 6.4 AU from the
star. Silicate material was also detected at 16 and 30 AU from

large planetesimals.
[48][49] Magnesium-rich olivine has also been detected,
strikingly similar to that found in the Solar System comets and
different from the olivine found in Solar System asteroids.[50] Olivine crystals can only form closer
than 10 AU from the star; therefore they have been transported to the belt after formation,
probably by radial mixing.[50]
Modeling of the dust disk at 100 AU from the star suggests the dust in this region may have been
produced by a series of collisions initiated by the destruction of planetesimals with radii of about
180 kilometers. After the initial collision, the debris undergoes further collisions in a process called
a collisional cascade. Similar processes have been inferred in the debris disks around Fomalhaut
and AU Microscopii.[51]

Falling evaporating bodies
The spectrum of Beta Pictoris shows strong short-term variability that was first noticed in the redshifted part of various absorption lines, which was interpreted as being caused by material falling
onto the star.[52] The source of this material was suggested to be small comet-like objects on orbits
which take them close to the star where they begin to evaporate, termed the "falling evaporating
bodies" model.[21] Transient blue-shifted absorption events were also detected, though less
frequently: these may represent a second group of objects on a different set of orbits.[53] Detailed
modeling indicates the falling evaporating bodies are unlikely to be mainly icy like comets, but
instead are probably composed of a mixed dust and ice core with a crust of refractory material.[54]
These objects may have been perturbed onto their star-grazing orbits by the gravitational influence
of a planet in a mildly eccentric orbit around Beta Pictoris at a distance of roughly 10 AU from the
star.[55] Falling evaporating bodies may also be responsible for the presence of gas located high
above the plane of the main debris disk.[56] A study from 2019 reported transiting exocomets with
TESS. The dips are asymmetric in nature and are consistent with models of evaporating comets
crossing the disc of the star. The comets are in a highly eccentric orbit and are non-periodic.[57]

Planetary system
On November 21, 2008, it was announced that infrared observations made in 2003 with the Very
Large Telescope had revealed a candidate planetary companion to the star.[58] In the autumn of

The radial velocity method is not well suited to study A-type stars like Beta Pictoris. The very young
age of the star makes the noise even worse. Current limits derived from this method are enough to
rule out hot Jupiter-type planets more massive than 2 Jupiter masses at a distance of less than
0.05 AU from the star. For planets orbiting at 1 AU, planets with less than 9 Jupiter masses would
have evaded detection.[22][31] Therefore, to find planets in the Beta Pictoris system, astronomers
look for the effects that the planet has on the circumstellar environment.
Multiple lines of evidence suggested the existence of a massive planet orbiting in the region around
10 AU from the star: the dust-free gap between the planetesimal belts at 6.4 AU and 16 AU suggest
this region is being cleared out;[49] a planet at this distance would explain the origin of the falling
evaporating bodies,[55] and the warps and inclined rings in the inner disk suggest a massive planet
on an inclined orbit is disrupting the disk.[44][62]
The observed planet by itself cannot explain the structure of the planetesimal belts at 30 AU and 52
AU from the star. These belts might be associated with smaller planets at 25 and 44 AU, with
around 0.5 and 0.1 Jupiter masses respectively.[22] Such a system of planets, if it exists, would be

The object was observed at an angular distance of 411
milliarcseconds from Beta Pictoris, which corresponds to a
distance in the plane of the sky of 8 AU. For comparison, the
orbital radii of the planets Jupiter and Saturn are 5.2 AU[63]
and 9.5 AU[64] respectively. The separation in the radial direction is unknown, so this is a lower
limit on the true separation. Estimates of its mass depend on theoretical models of planetary
evolution, and predict the object has about 8 Jupiter masses and is still cooling, with a temperature
ranging from 1400 to 1600 K. These figures come with the caveat that the models have not yet been
tested against real data in the likely ranges of mass and age for the planet.
The semimajor axis is 8–9 AU and its orbital period is 17–21 years.[65] A "transit-like event" was
observed in November 1981;[66][67] this is consistent with those estimates.[65] If this is confirmed
as a true transit, the inferred radius of the transiting object is 2–4 Jupiter radii, which is larger
than predicted by theoretical models. This may indicate that it is surrounded by a large ring system
or a moon-forming disc.[67]
Confirmation of a second planet in the Beta Pictoris system was announced on 6 October 2020.
The planet has a temperature of T = 1250 ± 50 K, a dynamical mass of M = 8.89 ± 0.75 MJup,[68]
and an age of 18.5 ± 2.5 Myr.[15] It has an orbital period of about 1,200 days (3.3 years) and a
semimajor axis of 2.7 AU, about 3.5 times closer to its parent star than Beta Pictoris b.[69][59] The
orbit of Beta Pictoris c is moderately eccentric, with an eccentricity of 0.24.[69][59]
This planet presents data with conflict with current, as of 2020, models for planetary formation. β
Pic c is at an age where planetary formations is predicted to occur via disk instability. However the
planet orbits at a distance of 2.7 AU, which prediction says is too close for disk instability to occur.
The low apparent magnitude, of MK = 14.3 ± 0.1, suggests that it formed via core accretion.[15]

Dust stream
In 2000, observations made with the Advanced Meteor Orbit Radar facility in New Zealand
revealed the presence of a stream of particles coming from the direction of Beta Pictoris, which
may be a dominant source of interstellar meteoroids in the Solar System.[23] The particles in the
Beta Pictoris dust stream are relatively large, with radii exceeding 20 micrometers, and their
velocities suggest that they must have left the Beta Pictoris system at roughly 25 km/s. These
particles may have been ejected from the Beta Pictoris debris disk as a result of the migration of gas
giant planets within the disk and may be an indication that the Beta Pictoris system is forming an

responsible and suggests that planets further than about 1 AU from the star cannot directly cause
the dust stream.[71]

Carina Nebula
Coordinates:

10h 45m 08.5s, −59° 52′ 04″

The Carina Nebula[7] or Eta Carinae Nebula[8]
(catalogued as NGC 3372; also known as the Great
Carina Nebula[9]) is a large, complex area of bright
and dark nebulosity in the constellation Carina,
located in the Carina–Sagittarius Arm of the Milky
Way galaxy. The nebula is approximately 8,500
light-years (2,600 pc) from Earth.[2]
The nebula has within its boundaries the large
Carina OB1 association and several related open
clusters, including numerous O-type stars and
several Wolf–Rayet stars. Carina OB1 encompasses
the star clusters Trumpler 14 and Trumpler 16.
Trumpler 14 is one of the youngest known star
clusters at half a million years old. Trumpler 16 is
the home of WR 25, currently the most luminous
star known in our Milky Way galaxy, together with
the less luminous but more massive and famous Eta
Carinae star system and the O2 supergiant
HD 93129A. Trumpler 15, Collinder 228,
Collinder 232, NGC 3324, and NGC 3293 are also
considered members of the association. NGC 3293 is
the oldest and furthest from Trumpler 14, indicating
sequential and ongoing star formation.
The nebula is one of the largest diffuse nebulae in
our skies. Although it is four times as large as and
even brighter than the famous Orion Nebula, the
Carina Nebula is much less well known due to its
location in the southern sky. It was discovered by
Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille in 1752 from the Cape of
Good Hope.
The Carina Nebula was selected as one of five cosmic
objects observed by the James Webb Space
Telescope, as part of the release of its first official
science images. A detailed image was made of an
early star-forming region of NGC 3324 known as the
Cosmic Cliffs.[10]

Objects within the Carina Nebula
Eta Carinae
Eta Carinae is a highly luminous hypergiant star. Estimates of
its mass range from 100 to 150 times the mass of the Sun, and
its luminosity is about four million times that of the Sun.

The Cosmic Cliffs at the edge of
NGC 3324, one of the first images
taken by the James Webb Space
Telescope

This object is currently the most massive star that can be
studied in great detail, because of its location and size. Several
other known stars may be more luminous and more massive, but data
on them is far less robust. (Caveat: Since examples such as the Pistol
Star have been demoted by improved data, one should be skeptical of
most available lists of "most massive stars". In 2006, Eta Carinae still
had the highest confirmed luminosity, based on data across a broad
range of wavelengths.) Stars with more than 80 times the mass of the
Sun produce more than a million times as much light as the Sun. They
are quite rare—only a few dozen in a galaxy as big as ours—and they
flirt with disaster near the Eddington limit, i.e., the outward pressure
of their radiation is almost strong enough to counteract gravity. Stars
that are more than 120 solar masses exceed the theoretical Eddington
limit, and their gravity is barely strong enough to hold in its radiation
and gas, resulting in a possible supernova or hypernova in the near
future.
Eta Carinae observed in
Eta Carinae's effects on the nebula can be seen directly. Dark globules
different wavelengths
and some other less visible objects have tails pointing directly away
from the massive star. The entire nebula would have looked very
different before the Great Eruption in the 1840s surrounded Eta
Carinae with dust, drastically reducing the amount of ultraviolet light it put into the nebula.

Homunculus Nebula
Within the large bright nebula is a much smaller feature, immediately surrounding Eta Carinae
itself, known as the Homunculus Nebula (from Latin meaning Little Man). It is believed to have
been ejected in an enormous outburst in 1841 which briefly made Eta Carinae the second-brightest
star in the sky.

The Homunculus Nebula is a small H II region, with gas
shocked into ionized and excited states.[11] It also absorbs much
of the light from the extremely luminous central stellar system
and re-radiates it as infrared (IR). It is the brightest object in
the sky at mid-IR wavelengths.[12]: 145–169

Eta Carinae, surrounded by the
Homunculus Nebula

The distance to the Homunculus can be derived from its
observed angular dimensions and calculated linear size,
assuming it is axially symmetric. The most accurate distance
obtained using this method is 7,660 ± 160 light-years
(2,350 ± 50 pc). The largest radius of the bipolar lobes in this
model is about 22,000 AU, and the axis is oriented 41° from the
line of sight, or 49° relative to the plane of the sky, which means
it is seen from Earth slightly more "end on" than "side on".[13]

Keyhole Nebula
The Keyhole, or Keyhole Nebula, is a small dark cloud of cold
molecules and dust within the Carina Nebula, containing bright
filaments of hot, fluorescing gas, silhouetted against the much
brighter background nebula. John Herschel used the term
"lemniscate-oval vacuity" when first describing it,[14] and
subsequently referred to it simply as the "oval vacuity".[15] The
term lemniscate continued to be used to describe this portion of

an 1873 Appleton's Journal article.[17] The name Keyhole
Nebula then came into common use, sometimes for the Keyhole
itself, sometimes to describe the whole of the Carina Nebula (signifying "the nebula that contains
the Keyhole").[18][19]
The diameter of the Keyhole structure is approximately seven light-years (2.1 pc). Its appearance
has changed significantly since it was first observed, possibly due to changes in the ionizing
radiation from Eta Carinae.[20] The Keyhole does not have its own NGC designation. It is
sometimes erroneously called NGC 3324,[21] but that catalogue designation refers to a reflection
and emission nebula just northwest of the Carina Nebula (or to its embedded star cluster).
[22][23][24]

Defiant Finger
A small Bok globule in the Keyhole Nebula (at RA 10h 44m 30s, Dec −59° 40') has been
photographed by the Hubble Space Telescope and is nicknamed the "Carina Defiant Finger" due to
its shape.[25] In Hubble images, light can be seen radiating off the edges of the globule; this is
especially visible in the southern tip, where the "finger" is. It is thought that the Defiant Finger is
being ionized by the bright Wolf–Rayet star WR 25, and/or Trumpler 16-244, a bright blue
supergiant. It has a mass of at least 6 M☉, and stars may be forming within it. Like other
interstellar clouds under intense radiation, the Defiant Finger will eventually be completely

200,000 to 1,000,000 years.[26]

Trumpler 14
Trumpler 14 is an open cluster with a diameter of six light-years
(1.8 pc), located within the inner regions of the Carina Nebula,
approximately 8,000 light-years (2,500 pc) from Earth.[27] It is
one of the main clusters of the Carina OB1 stellar association,
which is the largest association in the Carina Nebula.[12] About
2,000 stars have been identified in Trumpler 14.[28] and the total
mass of the cluster is estimated to be 4,300 M☉.[29]

astrometric measurements by the Gaia mission have confirmed
that it is the same distance as the rest of Carina OB1.[2]

Trumpler 16
Trumpler 16 is one of the main clusters of the Carina OB1 stellar
association, which is the largest association in the Carina

measures three light-years (0.92 pc) in height; nascent stars
inside the pillar fire off gas jets that stream from towering

WR 22
WR 22 is an eclipsing binary. The dynamical masses derived from orbital fitting vary from over
70 M☉ to less than 60 M☉ for the primary and about 21 to 27 M☉ for the secondary.[30] The
spectroscopic mass of the primary has been calculated at 74 M☉[31] or 78.1 M☉.[32]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carina_Nebula

WR 25 is a binary system in the central portion of the Carina
Nebula, a member of the Trumpler 16 cluster. The primary is a
Wolf–Rayet star, possibly the most luminous star in the galaxy.
The secondary is hard to detect but thought to be a luminous
OB star.

HD 93129
HD 93129 is a triple star system of O-class stars in Carina. All
three stars of HD 93129 are among the most luminous in the
galaxy;[33] HD 93129 consists of two clearly resolved
components, HD 93129 A and HD 93129 B, and HD 93129 A
itself is made up of two much closer stars.

The brightest star is WR 25

HD 93129 A has been resolved into two components. The spectrum is dominated by the brighter
component, although the secondary is only 0.9 magnitudes fainter. HD 93129 Aa is an O2
supergiant and Ab is an O3.5 main sequence star.[34] Their separation has decreased from 55
milliarcseconds in 2004 to only 27 mas in 2013, but an accurate orbit is not available.[35]
HD 93129 B is an O3.5 main-sequence star 3 arcseconds away from the closer pair. It is about 1.5
magnitudes fainter than the combined HD 93129 A, and is approximately the same brightness as
HD 93129 Ab.[36][37]

HD 93250
HD 93250 is one of the brightest stars in the region of the Carina Nebula. It is only 7.5 arcminutes
from Eta Carinae,[38] and HD 93250 is considered to be a member of the same loose open cluster
Trumpler 16, although it appears closer to the more compact Trumpler 14.[39]
HD 93250 is known to be a binary star, however, individual spectra of the two components have
never been observed but are thought to be very similar. The spectral type of HD 93250 has
variously been given as O5,[40] O6/7,[41] O4,[42] and O3.[43] It has sometimes been classified as a
main sequence star and sometimes as a giant star.[42][43] The Galactic O-Star Spectroscopic Survey
has used it as the standard star for the newly created O4 subgiant spectral type.[44]

HD 93205
HD 93205 is a binary system of two large stars.
The more massive member of the pair is an O3.5 main sequence star. The spectrum shows some
ionized nitrogen and helium emission lines, indicating some mixing of fusion products to the
surface and a strong stellar wind. The mass calculated from apsidal motion of the orbits is 40 to
60 M☉. This is somewhat lower than expected from evolutionary modelling of a star with its
observed parameters.[45]
The less massive member is an O8 main sequence star of approximately 20 M☉.[46] It moves in its
orbit at a speed of over 300 km/s (190 mi/s) and is considered to be a relativistic binary, which

HD 169142
HD 169142 is a single Herbig Ae/Be star. Its
surface temperature is 7650 ± 150 K. HD 169142 is
depleted of heavy elements compared to the Sun,
with a metallicity Fe/H index of −0.375 ± 0.125,
but is much younger at an age of 7.5 ± 4.5 million
years.[2] The star is rotating slowly and has
relatively low stellar activity for a Herbig Ae/Be
star.[3]

HD 169142

Planetary system
The Disk
The star is surrounded by a complex, rapidly
evolving protoplanetary disk with two gaps. In the
1995-2005 period the disk inner edge has moved
inward by 0.3 AU.[5] The dust of the disk is rich in
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons[6] and carbon
monoxide.[7]
A study using ALMA data found that the water
(H2O) snow line is at around 20 astronomical
units and the planet b is forming in beyond the
water and carbon dioxide (CO2) snow lines, but
within the carbon monoxide (CO) snow line. The
CO snow line lies at around 150 AU.[8]
The study also detected a range of molecules in the
disk: diazenylium (N2H+), methanol (CH3OH),
[CI], deuterated hydrogen cyanide (DCN), carbon
monosulfide (CS, C34S, 13CS), thioformaldehyde
(H2CS), formaldehyde (H2CO), cyanoacetylene
(HC3N), cyclopropenylidene (c-C3H2), sulfur
monoxide (SO, previously detected) and
deuterated aldehyde (DCO, previously detected).
The detection of methanol in this warm disk is
interpreted as a leftover from a earlier and colder
stage of the disk. The methanol is now sublimating
in this warmer phase. This means that complex
ices can survive the disk formation process.[8]

The Planet
The annular gap and inner cavity observed in this
protoplanetary disk both suggested the presence of
Several
protoplanet
embedded planets.[2]
candidates have been suggested in the literature
starting from 2014.[9][10]
Nonetheless, a particular protoplanet candidate
detected in 2015 and 2017 with the SPHERE
instrument on the VLT appears to stand out,
hereafter HD 169142 b.[11] A paper from 2023[12]
confirmed that the motion of this protoplanet
candidate was consistent with Keplerian motion.
The object shifted with a change of the position
angle of 10.2±2.8° between 2015 and 2019. The
researchers point out three lines of evidence
arguing in favour of this object being a
protoplanet:

1. The object is found in annular gap separating
the two bright rings of the disc, as predicted in
theory
2. The protoplanet moved between 2015, 2017 and 2019 consistent with Keplerian motion of an
object at a distance of about 37 astronomical units from its star.
3. A spiral-shaped signal consistent with the expected outer spiral wake triggered by a planet in
the gap, based on simulations of the system.

The researchers also found the near-infrared colors of the object are consistent with starlight
scattered by dust around the protoplanet. This dust could be a circumplanetary disk or a dusty
envelope around the protoplanet.[12]
A study from June 2023, using archived ALMA data found sulfur monoxide and silicon
monosulfide in the disk at the position of planet b. The paper also found compact 12CO and 13CO
emission at the position of the planet. Carbon monoxide and sulfur monoxide were detected in
other disks in the past and they are thought to be connected to protoplanets. Silicon monosulfide
on the other hand was never before detected in any other disk and can only be detected if silicates
are released from nearby dust grains in massive shock waves caused by gas travelling at high
velocities. It is thought that planet b is driving an outflow causing these high velocities.[13][14]
Outflows from proto-jovian planets were hypothesised since 1998.[15]
Outflows are known around isolated young proto-brown dwarfs,[16] but HD 169142 b could be the
first confirmed protoplanet around a star showing clear evidence of an outflow. Evidence for inflow
or outflows suspected to be caused by planets exist for other disks, such as a signature in the CI gas
of HD 163296.[14]

HR 8799
Coordinates:

23h 07m 28.7150s, +21° 08′ 03.302″

HR 8799 is a roughly 30 million-year-old
main-sequence star located 133.3 lightyears (40.9 parsecs) away from Earth in
the constellation of Pegasus. It has
roughly 1.5 times the Sun's mass and
4.9 times its luminosity. It is part of a
system that also contains a debris disk
and at least four massive planets. Those
planets, along with Fomalhaut b, were the
first exoplanets whose orbital motion was
confirmed by direct imaging. The star is a
Gamma Doradus variable: its luminosity
changes because of non-radial pulsations
of its surface. The star is also classified as
a Lambda Boötis star, which means its
surface layers are depleted in iron peak
elements. It is the only known star which
is simultaneously a Gamma Doradus
variable, a Lambda Boötis type, and a
Vega-like star (a star with excess infrared
emission caused by a circumstellar disk).

Location
HR 8799 is a star that is visible to the
naked eye. It has a magnitude 5.96 and it
is located inside the western edge of the
great square of Pegasus almost exactly
halfway between Scheat and Markab. The
star's name of HR 8799 is its line number
in the Bright Star Catalogue.

lines in the star's spectrum, as well as the Encyclopaedia
star's effective temperature, best match
the typical properties of an F0 V star. However, the strength of the calcium II K absorption line and
the other metallic lines are more like those of an A5 V star. The star's spectral type is therefore
written as kA5 hF0 mA5 V; λ Boo.[3][4]
Age determination of this star shows some variation based on the method used. Statistically, for
stars hosting a debris disk, the luminosity of this star suggests an age of about 20–150 million
years. Comparison with stars having similar motion through space gives an age in the range
30–160 million years. Given the star's position on the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram of luminosity
versus temperature, it has an estimated age in the range of 30–1,128 million years. λ Boötis stars
like this are generally young, with a mean age of a billion years. More accurately, asteroseismology
also suggests an age of approximately a billion years.[10] However, this is disputed because it would
make the planets become brown dwarfs to fit into the cooling models. Brown dwarfs would not be

stable in such a configuration. The best accepted value for an age of HR 8799 is 30 million years,
consistent with being a member of the Columba association co-moving group of stars.[11]
Earlier analysis of the star's spectrum reveals that it has a slight overabundance of carbon and
oxygen compared to the Sun (by approximately 30% and 10% respectively). While some Lambda
Boötis stars have sulfur abundances similar to that of the Sun, this is not the case for HR 8799; the
sulfur abundance is only around 35% of the solar level. The star is also poor in elements heavier
than sodium: for example, the iron abundance is only 28% of the solar iron abundance.[12]
Asteroseismic observations of other pulsating Lambda Boötis stars suggest that the peculiar
abundance patterns of these stars are confined to the surface only: the bulk composition is likely
more normal. This may indicate that the observed element abundances are the result of the
accretion of metal-poor gas from the environment around the star.[13]
In 2020, spectral analysis utilizing multiple data sources have detected an inconsistency in prior
data and concluded the star carbon and oxygen abundances are the same or slightly higher than
+6

solar. The iron abundance was updated to 30−5 % of solar value.[7]
Astroseismic analysis using spectroscopic data indicates that the rotational inclination of the star is
constrained to be greater than or approximately equal to 40°. This contrasts with the planets'
orbital inclinations, which are in roughly the same plane at an angle of about 20° ± 10°. Hence,
there may be an unexplained misalignment between the rotation of the star and the orbits of its
planets.[14] Observation of this star with the Chandra X-ray Observatory indicates that it has a
weak level of magnetic activity, but the X-ray activity is much higher than that of an A-type star like
Altair. This suggests that the internal structure of the star more closely resembles that of an
F0 star. The temperature of the stellar corona is about 3.0 million K.[15]

On 13 November 2008, Christian Marois of the National Research Council of Canada's Herzberg
Institute of Astrophysics and his team announced they had directly observed three planets orbiting
the star with the Keck and Gemini telescopes in Hawaii,[20][21][22][23] in both cases employing
adaptive optics to make observations in the infrared.[b] A precovery observation of the outer
3 planets was later found in infrared images obtained in 1998 by the Hubble Space Telescope's
NICMOS instrument, after a newly developed image-processing technique was applied.[24] Further

observations in 2009–2010 revealed the fourth giant planet
orbiting inside the first three planets at a projected separation
just less than 15 ��,[8][25] which has been confirmed by
multiple studies.[26]
The outer planet orbits inside a dusty disk like the Solar Kuiper
belt. It is one of the most massive disks known around any star
within 300 light years of Earth, and there is room in the inner
system for terrestrial planets.[22] There is an additional debris
disk just inside the orbit of the innermost planet.[8]
The orbital radii of planets e, d, c, and b are 2–3 times those of
Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune's orbits, respectively.
Orbit diagram of the HR 8799
Because of the inverse square law relating radiation intensity to
planetary system
distance from the source, comparable radiation intensities are
present at distances √ 4.9 ≈ 2.2 times farther from HR 8799
than from the Sun, the upshot being that corresponding planets in the solar and HR 8799 systems
receive similar amounts of stellar radiation.[8]
These objects are near the upper mass limit for classification as planets; if they exceeded 13 Jupiter
masses, they would be capable of deuterium fusion in their interiors and thus qualify as brown
dwarfs under the definition of these terms used by the IAU's Working Group on Extrasolar
Planets.[27] If the mass estimates are correct, the HR 8799 system is the first multiple-planet
extrasolar system to be directly imaged.[21] The orbital motion of the planets is in an anticlockwise
direction and was confirmed via multiple observations dating back to 1998.[20] The system is more
likely to be stable if the planets e, d, and c are in a 4:2:1 resonance, which would imply that the
orbit of the planet d has an eccentricity exceeding 0.04 in order to match the observational
constraints. Planetary systems with the best-fit masses from evolutionary models would be stable if
the outer three planets are in a 1:2:4 orbital resonance (similar to the Laplace resonance between
Jupiter's inner three Galilean satellites: Io, Europa, and Ganymede as well as three of the planets in
the Gliese 876 system).[8] However, it is disputed if planet b is in resonance with the other
3 planets. According to dynamical simulations, the HR 8799 planetary system may be even an
extrasolar system with multiple resonance 1:2:4:8.[18] The 4 young planets are still glowing red hot
from the heat of their formation, and are larger than Jupiter and over time they will cool and
shrink to the sizes of 0.8–1.0 Jupiter radii.
The broadband photometry of planets b, c and d has shown that there may be significant clouds in
their atmospheres,[25] while the infrared spectroscopy of planets b and c points to non-equilibrium
CO / CH4 chemistry.[8] Near-infrared observations with the Project 1640 integral field
spectrograph on the Palomar Observatory have shown that compositions between the four planets
vary significantly. This is a surprise since the planets presumably formed in the same way from the
same disk and have similar luminosities.[28]

Planet spectra
A number of studies have used the spectra of HR 8799's planets to determine their chemical
compositions and constrain their formation scenarios. The first spectroscopic study of planet b
(performed at near-infrared wavelengths) detected strong water absorption and hints of methane

The spectrum is that of a giant exoplanet,
orbiting around the bright and very young
star HR 8799, about 130 light-years away.
This spectrum of the star and the planet
was obtained with the NACO adaptive
optics instrument on ESO's Very Large
Telescope.

absorption.[29] Subsequently, weak methane and carbon
monoxide absorption in this planet's atmosphere was also
detected, indicating efficient vertical mixing of the
atmosphere and a disequilibrium CO / CH4 ratio at the
photosphere. Compared to models of planetary
atmospheres, this first spectrum of planet b is best
matched by a model of enhanced metallicity (about
10 times the metallicity of the Sun), which may support
the notion that this planet formed through coreaccretion.[30]

The first simultaneous spectra of all four known planets in
the HR 8799 system were obtained in 2012 using the
Project 1640 instrument at Palomar Observatory. The
near-infrared spectra from this instrument confirmed the
red colors of all four planets and are best matched by
models of planetary atmospheres that include clouds. Though these spectra do not directly
correspond to any known astrophysical objects, some of the planet spectra demonstrate similarities
with L- and T-type brown dwarfs and the night-side spectrum of Saturn. The implications of the
simultaneous spectra of all four planets obtained with Project 1640 are summarized as follows:
Planet b contains ammonia and/or acetylene as well as carbon dioxide, but has little methane;
planet c contains ammonia, perhaps some acetylene but neither carbon dioxide nor substantial
methane; planet d contains acetylene, methane, and carbon dioxide but ammonia is not
definitively detected; planet e contains methane and acetylene but no ammonia or carbon dioxide.
The spectrum of planet e is similar to a reddened spectrum of Saturn.[28]
Moderate-resolution near-infrared spectroscopy, obtained with the Keck telescope, definitively
detected carbon monoxide and water absorption lines in the atmosphere of planet c. The carbonto-oxygen ratio, which is thought to be a good indicator of the formation history for giant planets,
for planet c was measured to be slightly greater than that of the host star HR 8799. The enhanced
carbon-to-oxygen ratio and depleted levels of carbon and oxygen in planet c favor a history in
which the planet formed through core accretion.[31] However, it is important to note that
conclusions about the formation history of a planet based solely on its composition may be
inaccurate if the planet has undergone significant migration, chemical evolution, or core dredging.
Later, in November 2018, researchers confirmed the existence of water and the absence of methane
in the atmosphere of HR 8799 c using high-resolution spectroscopy and near-infrared adaptive
optics (NIRSPAO) at the Keck Observatory.[32][33]
The red colors of the planets may be explained by the presence of iron and silicate atmospheric
clouds, while their low surface gravities might explain the strong disequilibrium concentrations of
carbon monoxide and the lack of strong methane absorption.[31]

Debris disk
In January 2009 the Spitzer Space Telescope obtained images of the debris disk around HR 8799.
Three components of the debris disk were distinguished:
1. Warm dust (T ≈ 150 K) orbiting within the innermost planet (e). The inner and outer edges of
this belt are close to 4:1 and 2:1 resonances with the planet.[8]

2. A broad zone of cold dust (T ≈ 45 K) with a sharp inner
edge orbiting just outside the outermost planet (b). The
inner edge of this belt is approximately in 3:2 resonance
with said planet, similar to Neptune and the Kuiper belt.[8]
3. A dramatic halo of small grains originating in the cold dust
component.
The halo is unusual and implies a high level of dynamic activity
which is likely due to gravitational stirring by the massive
planets.[34] The Spitzer team says that collisions are likely
occurring among bodies similar to those in the Kuiper Belt and
that the three large planets may not yet have settled into their
final, stable orbits.[35]
In the photo, the bright, yellow-white portions of the dust cloud
come from the outer cold disk. The huge extended dust halo,
seen in orange-red, has a diameter of ≈ 2,000 ��. The diameter
of Pluto's orbit (≈ 80 ��) is shown for reference as a dot in the
centre.[36]

debris disk, January 2009. The
small dot in the centre is the size of
Pluto's orbit.

This disk is so thick that it threatens the young system's
stability.[37]

Vortex Coronagraph: Testbed for high-contrast imaging technology
Up until the year 2010, telescopes could only directly image
exoplanets under exceptional circumstances. Specifically, it is
easier to obtain images when the planet is especially large
(considerably larger than Jupiter), widely separated from its
parent star, and hot so that it emits intense infrared radiation.
However, in 2010 a team from NASAs Jet Propulsion
Laboratory demonstrated that a vortex coronagraph could
enable small telescopes to directly image planets.[38] They did
this by imaging the previously imaged HR 8799 planets using
just a 1.5 m portion of the Hale Telescope.

NICMOS images

the star HR 8799 using a vortex
coronagraph on a 1.5 m portion of
the Hale Telescope

In 2009, an old NICMOS image was processed to show a predicted exoplanet around HR 8799.[39]
In 2011, three further exoplanets were rendered viewable in a NICMOS image taken in 1998, using
advanced data processing.[39] The image allows the planets' orbits to be better characterised, since
they take many decades to orbit their host star.[39]

Search for radio emissions
Starting in 2010, astronomers searched for radio emissions from the exoplanets orbiting HR 8799
using the radio telescope at Arecibo Observatory. Despite the large masses, warm temperatures,

and brown dwarf-like luminosities, they failed to detect any emissions at 5 GHz down to a flux
density detection threshold of 1.0 mJy.[40]

Notes
a. The star is a member of the Lambda Boötis class of peculiar stars, thus the observed
abundance may not reflect the abundances of the star as a whole.
b. The planets are young and therefore they are still hot and bright in the near-infrared part of the
spectrum.

Luhman 16
Coordinates:

10h 49m 18.723s, −53° 19′ 09.86″

Luhman 16 (also designated WISE
1049−5319
or
WISE
J104915.57−531906.1) is a binary
brown-dwarf system in the southern
constellation Vela at a distance of
approximately 6.5 light-years (2.0
parsecs) from the Sun. These are the
closest-known brown dwarfs and the
closest system
found
since
the
measurement of the proper motion of
Barnard's Star in 1916,[11][12] and the
third-closest-known system to the Sun
(after the Alpha Centauri system and
Barnard's Star). The primary is of
spectral type L7.5 and the secondary of
type T0.5 ± 1 (and is hence near the L–T
transition).[13]
The
masses
of
Luhman 16 A and B are 33.5 and 28.6
Jupiter masses, respectively, and their
ages are estimated to be 600–800
million years.[5] Luhman 16 A and B
orbit each other at a distance of about 3.5
astronomical units[4] with an orbital
period of approximately 27 years.[5]

announced in 2013 (the pair are the only
two objects announced in the discovery
paper). The system was found by
comparing WISE images at different
epochs to reveal objects that have high
proper motions.[11][4]
Luhman 16 appears in the sky close to
the galactic plane, which is densely
populated by stars; the abundance of
light sources makes it difficult to spot
faint objects. This explains why an object
so near to the Sun was not discovered in
earlier searches.[4]

with a position angle of 138°.[1] The
similarity of this position angle with that
of the resolved pair in the GMOS image

Name
Eric E. Mamajek proposed the name
Luhman 16 for the system, with the

the frequently updated Washington
Double Star Catalog (WDS). Kevin
Luhman had already published several
new discoveries of binary stars that have
been compiled in the WDS with
discovery identifier "LUH". The WDS
catalog now lists this system with the
identifier 10493−5319 and discoverer

The rationale is that Luhman 16 is easier
to

than
WISE
J104915.57−531906.1 and that "it seems

silly to call this object by a 24-character
name (space included)".[1][15][note 2] The
"phone number names" also include WISE J1049−5319 and WISE 1049−5319. Luhman–WISE 1
was proposed as another alternative.[1]
As a binary object it is also called Luhman 16AB.

Astrometry
Position in the sky
Luhman 16 is located in the southern celestial hemisphere in the constellation Vela. As of July
2015, its components are the nearest-known celestial objects in this constellation outside the Solar
System. Its celestial coordinates: RA = 10h 49m 18.723s, Dec = −53° 19′ 09.86″.[1]

Distance
The trigonometric parallax of Luhman 16 as
published by Sahlmann & Lazorenko (2015) is
0.500 51 ± 0.000 11 arcsec, corresponding to a
distance of 6.5166 ± 0.0013 light-years
(1.998 ± 0.0004 parsecs).[13]

Proximity to the Solar System
Currently Luhman 16 is the third-closest-known
star/brown-dwarf system to the Sun after the
triple Alpha Centauri system (4.37 ly) and
Barnard's Star (5.98 ly), pushing Wolf 359 (7.78
ly) to the fifth place, along with the discovery of
WISE 0855−0714. It also holds several records:
the nearest brown dwarf, the nearest L-type
dwarf, and possibly the nearest T-type dwarf (if
component B is of T-type).

Proximity to Alpha Centauri

The position of Luhman 16 on a radar map among all
stellar objects or stellar systems within 9 light years
(ly) from the map's center, the Sun (Sol). The
diamond-shapes are their positions entered according
to right ascension in hours angle (indicated at the edge
of the map's reference disc), and according to their
declination. The second mark shows each's distance
from Sol, with the concentric circles indicating the
distance in steps of one ly.

Luhman 16 is the nearest-known star/browndwarf system to Alpha Centauri, located 3.577 ly
(1.097 pc) from Alpha Centauri AB, and 3.520 ly
(1.079 pc) from Proxima Centauri.[note 3] Both
systems
are
located
in
neighboring
constellations, in the same part of the sky as
seen from Earth, but Luhman 16 is a bit farther away. Before the discovery of Luhman 16, the Solar
System was the nearest-known system to Alpha Centauri.
Luhman 16 is closer to Proxima Centauri than to Alpha Centauri AB, just like Earth, even though
Luhman 16 is further from Earth than Alpha Centauri system. Therefore Luhman 16 has smaller
angular distance to Proxima Centauri than to Alpha Centauri AB in Earth's sky, and this makes
more contribution to the distance difference from Luhman 16 to Alpha Centauri than to the
distance difference between them and Earth.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhman_16

Proper motion
The proper motion of Luhman 16 as published by Garcia
et al. (2017), is about 2.79″/year, which is relatively large
due to the proximity of Luhman 16.[5]

Radial velocity
The radial velocity of component A is 23.1 ± 1.1 km/s
(14.35 ± 0.68 mi/s), and the radial velocity of
component B is 19.5 ± 1.2 km/s (12.12 ± 0.75 mi/s).[8]
Since values of the radial velocity are positive, the system
currently is moving away from the Solar System.

Luhman 16A and B orbit each other at a
distance of only 3.5 AU.[16]

Assuming these values for the components, and a mass ratio of Luhman 16 from Sahlmann &
Lazorenko (2015) of 0.78,[13] the system's barycentre radial velocity is about 21.5 km/s
(13.4 mi/s).[note 4] This implies that Luhman 16 passed by the Solar System around 36,000 years
ago at a minimal distance of about 5.05 ly (1.55 pc).

Orbit and masses
In Luhman 16's original discovery paper, Luhman et al. (2013) estimated the orbital period of its
components to be about 25 years.[4]
Garcia et al. (2017), using archival observations extending over 31 years, found an orbital period of
27.4 years with a semi-major axis of 3.54 AU. This orbit has an eccentricity of 0.35 and an
+1.3

inclination of 79.5°. The masses of the components were found to be 34.2 −1.2 MJup and
+1.1
27.9 −1.0 MJup, respectively, with their mass ratio being about 0.82.[5]
With the data from Gaia DR2 in 2018, their orbit was refined to a period of 27.5 ± 0.4 years, with a
semi-major axis of 3.56 ± 0.025 AU, an eccentricity of 0.343 ± 0.005, and an inclination of
100.26° ± 0.05° (facing the opposite direction as the 2017 study found). Their masses were
+0.31

+0.26

additionally refined to 33.51 −0.29 MJup and 28.55 −0.25 MJup.[6]
These results are consistent with all previous estimates of the orbit and component masses.[5][1]
[3][13]

By comparing the rotation periods of the brown dwarfs with the projected rotational velocities, it
appears that both brown dwarfs are viewed roughly equator-on, and they are aligned well to their
orbits.[17]

Age
A 2013 paper, published shortly after Luhman 16 was discovered, concluded that the brown dwarf
belongs to the thin disk of the Milky Way with 96% probability, and therefore does not belong to a
young moving group.[1] Based on lithium absorption lines the system has a maximum age of about

11/15/2023, 8:07 PM

Luhman 16 - Wikipedia

6 of 12

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhman_16

3–4.5 Gyr.[18][19] Observations with the VLT showed that the system is older than 120 Myr.[20]
However, in 2022, Luhman 16 was found to be a member of the newly discovered Oceanus moving
group, which has an age of 510 ± 95 Myr.[21]

Search for planets
In December 2013, perturbations of the orbital motions in the system were reported, suggesting a
third body in the system. The period of this possible companion was a few months, suggesting an
orbit around one of the brown dwarfs. Any companion would need to be below the brown-dwarf
mass limit, because it would otherwise have been detected through direct imaging. Researchers
estimated the odds of a false positive as 0.002%, assuming the measurements had not been made
in error. If confirmed, this would have been the first exoplanet discovered astrometrically. They
estimate the planet to likely have a mass between "a few" and 30 MJup, although they mention that
a more massive planet would be brighter and therefore would affect the "photocenter" or measured
position of the star. This would make it difficult to measure the astrometric movement of an
exoplanet around it.[7]
Subsequent astrometric monitoring of Luhman 16 with the Very Large Telescope has excluded the
presence of any third object with a mass greater than 2 MJup orbiting around either brown dwarf
with a period between 20 and 300 days. Luhman 16 does not contain any close-in giant planets.[13]
Observations with the Hubble Space Telescope in 2014–2016 confirmed the nonexistence of any
additional brown dwarfs in the system. It additionally ruled out any Neptune mass (17 MEarth)
objects with an orbital period of one to two years.[22] This makes the existence of the previously
found exoplanet candidate highly unlikely.

Atmosphere
A study by Gillon et al. (2013) found that Luhman 16B exhibited uneven surface illumination
during its rotation.[23] On 5 May 2013, Crossfield et al. (2014) used the European Southern
Observatory 's Very Large Telescope (VLT) to directly observe the Luhman 16 system for five hours,
the equivalent of a full rotation of Luhman 16B.[24][25] Their research confirmed Gillon et al. 's
observation, finding a large, dark region at the middle latitudes, a bright area near its upper pole,
and mottled illumination elsewhere. They suggest this variant illumination indicates "patchy global
clouds", where darker areas represent thick clouds and brighter areas are holes in the cloud layer
permitting light from the interior.[24][25] Luhman 16B's illumination patterns change rapidly, on a
day-to-day basis.[23][17] Luhman 16B is one of the most photometrically variable brown dwarfs
known, sometimes varying with an amplitude of over 20%.[26] Only 2MASS J21392676+0220226
is known to be more variable.[26]
Heinze et al. (2021) observed variability in spectral lines of alkali metals such as potassium and
sodium; they suggested that the variations were caused by changes in cloud cover, which changed
the local chemical equilibrium with chlorides. Lightning or aurorae were deemed possible, but less
likely.[26]
Luhman 16B's lightcurve shows evidence of differential rotation. There is evidence of equatorial
regions and mid-latitude regions with different rotation periods. The main period is 5.28 hours,

11/15/2023, 8:07 PM

corresponding to the rotation period of the equatorial region.[17] Meanwhile, the rotation period of
Luhman 16A is likely 6.94 hours.[17]

Radio and X-ray activity
In a study by Osten et al. (2015), Luhman 16 was observed with the Australia Telescope Compact
Array in radio waves and with the Chandra X-ray Observatory in X-rays. No radio or X-ray activity
was found at Luhman 16 AB, and constraints on radio and X-ray activity were presented, which are
"the strongest constraints obtained so far for the radio and X-ray luminosity of any ultracool
dwarf".[27]

with a dark cloud L1450 (Barnard 205). Estimates of the
distance to this nebula range from 980–1,140 ly
(300–350 pc).[4]
This nebula is in the western part[4] of the Perseus molecular
cloud and is a young region of very active star formation,[6]
being one of the best-studied objects of its type.[4] It contains a
fairly typical hierarchy of star clusters that are still embedded
in the molecular cloud in which they formed,[7] which are split
into two main sub-groups to the north and south. Most of the
infrared emission is happening in the southern part of the
nebula. A significant portion of the stars seen in the infrared
are in the pre-main sequence stage of their evolution.[6]
The nebula region has a combined mass of approximately
450 M☉,[4] while the cluster contains around 150 stars with a
median age of a million years and a combined mass of 100 M☉.
The average star formation rate is 1 × 10−4 M☉ yr–1.[4] Within
the nebula are 20 young stellar objects producing outflows,
including Herbig–Haro objects, and a total of 95 X-ray sources
that are associated with known members of embedded star
clusters.[6] In 2011 researchers reported finding 30 to 40
brown dwarf objects in the cloud and in the Rho Ophiuchi
cloud complex.[8]

TRAPPIST-1
Coordinates:

23h 06m 29.383s, −05° 02′ 28.59″

TRAPPIST-1 is a cool red dwarf star[b] with seven known exoplanets.
It lies in the constellation Aquarius about 40.66 light-years away from
Earth, and has a surface temperature of about 2,566 kelvins (2,290
degrees Celsius; 4,160 degrees Fahrenheit). Its radius is slightly larger
than Jupiter and it has a mass of about 9% of the Sun. It is estimated to
be 7.6 billion years old, making it older than the Solar System. The
discovery of the star was first published in 2000.
Observations in 2016 from the Transiting Planets and Planetesimals
Small Telescope (TRAPPIST) at La Silla Observatory in Chile and other
telescopes led to the discovery of two terrestrial planets in orbit around
TRAPPIST-1. In 2017, further analysis of the original observations
identified five more planets, of unknown types. It takes the seven
planets between about 1.5 and 19 days to orbit around the star in
circular orbits. They are likely tidally locked to TRAPPIST-1, such that
one side of each planet always faces the star, leading to permanent day
on one side and permanent night on the other. Their masses are
comparable to that of Earth and they all lie in the same plane; from
Earth they seem to move past the disk of the star.
Up to four of the planets – designated d, e, f and g – orbit at distances
where temperatures are suitable for the existence of liquid water, and
are thus potentially hospitable to life. There is no evidence of an
atmosphere on any of the planets. It is unclear whether radiation
emissions from TRAPPIST-1 would allow for such atmospheres. The
planets have low densities; they may consist of large amounts of volatile
materials. Due to the possibility of several of the planets being
habitable, the system has drawn interest from researchers and has
appeared in popular culture.

The star now known as TRAPPIST-1 was discovered in 1999 by
astronomer John Gizis and colleagues[16] during a survey of close-by
ultra-cool dwarf stars.[17][18] It appeared in sample C[16][17] of the
surveyed stars, which was obtained in June 1999. Publication of the
discovery took place in 2000.[19] The name is a reference to the
TRansiting Planets and PlanetesImals Small Telescope (TRAPPIST)

star.[23]

Its planetary system was discovered by a team led by Michaël Gillon, a
Belgian astronomer[24] at the University of Liege,[25] in 2016[26] during
observations made at the La Silla Observatory, Chile,[27][28] using the
TRAPPIST telescope. The discovery was based on anomalies in the light
curves[d] measured by the telescope in 2015. These were initially
interpreted as indicating the existence of three planets. In 2016,
separate discoveries revealed that the third planet was in fact multiple
planets. The telescopes and observatories involved were[11] the Spitzer
Space Telescope; the ground-based TRAPPIST and TRAPPIST-North in

The observations of TRAPPIST-1 are considered among the most

Complementing the findings were observations by the Himalayan
Chandra Telescope, the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope, and the
Very Large Telescope.[32] Since then, research has confirmed the
existence of at least seven planets in the system,[33] the orbits of which
have been calculated using measurements from the Spitzer and Kepler
telescopes.[34] Some news reports incorrectly attributed the discovery of
the TRAPPIST-1 planets to NASA; in fact the TRAPPIST project that led
to their discovery received funding from both NASA and the European
Research Council of the European Union (EU).[35]

Description
TRAPPIST-1 is in the constellation Aquarius,[25] five degrees south of
the celestial equator.[e][1][37] It is a relatively close star[38] located
40.66 ± 0.04 light-years from Earth,[f][1] with a large proper
motion[g][38] and no companion stars.[41]
It is a red dwarf of spectral class M8.0 ± 0.5,[h][32][44] meaning it is
relatively small and cold.[45] With a radius 12% of that of the Sun,
TRAPPIST-1 is only slightly larger than the planet Jupiter (though much
more massive).[32] Its mass is approximately 9% of that of the Sun,[45]
being just sufficient to allow nuclear fusion to take place.[46][47]
TRAPPIST-1's density is unusually low for a red dwarf.[48] It has a low
effective temperature[i] of 2,566 K (2,293 °C) making it, as of 2022, the
coldest-known star to host planets.[50] TRAPPIST-1 is cold enough for
condensates to form in its photosphere;[j] these have been detected
through the polarisation they induce in its radiation during transits of
its planets.[52]

Rotation period and age
Measurements of TRAPPIST-1's rotation have yielded a period of 3.3 days; earlier
measurements of 1.4 days appear to have been caused by changes in the
distribution of its starspots.[61] Its rotational axis may be slightly offset from that
of its planets.[62]
Using a combination of techniques, the age of TRAPPIST-1 has been estimated at
about 7.6 ± 2.2 billion years,[63] making it older than the Solar System, which is
about 4.5 billion years old.[64] It is expected to shine for ten trillion years – about
700 times[65] longer than the present age of the Universe[66] – whereas the Sun
will run out of hydrogen and leave the main sequence[m] in a few billion years.[65]

Activity
Photospheric features have been detected on TRAPPIST-1.[68] The Kepler and Spitzer Space Telescopes have observed
possible bright spots, which may be faculae,[n][70][71] although some of these may be too large to qualify as such.[72] Bright

spots are correlated to the occurrence of some stellar flares.[o][73]
The star has a strong magnetic field[74] with a mean intensity of about 600 gauss.[p][76] The magnetic field drives high
chromospheric[q][74] activity, and may be capable of trapping coronal mass ejections.[r][69][77]
According to Garraffo et al. (2017), TRAPPIST-1 loses about 3 × 10−14 solar masses per year[78] to the stellar wind, a rate
which is about 1.5 times that of the Sun. [79] Dong et al. (2018) simulated the observed properties of TRAPPIST-1 with a
mass loss of 4.1 × 10−15 solar masses per year.[78] Simulations to estimate mass loss are complicated because, as of 2019,
most of the parameters that govern TRAPPIST-1's stellar wind are not known from direct observation.[80]

Planetary system
TRAPPIST-1 is orbited by seven planets, designated TRAPPIST-1b, 1c, 1d, 1e,
1f, 1g, and 1h[81] in alphabetic order going out from the star.[s][84] These
planets have orbital periods ranging from 1.5–19 days,[85][86][6] at distances of
0.011–0.059 astronomical units[t] (1,700,000–8,900,000 km).[88]
All the planets are much closer to their star than Mercury is to the Sun,[26]
making the TRAPPIST-1 system very compact.[89] Kral et al. (2018) did not
detect any comets around TRAPPIST-1,[90] and Marino et al. (2020) found no
evidence of a Kuiper belt,[91] although it is uncertain whether a Solar Systemlike belt around TRAPPIST-1 would be observable from Earth.[92]
Observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array found no evidence of a
circumstellar dust disk.[93]
The inclinations of planetary orbits relative to the system's ecliptic are less
than 0.1 degrees[u],[95] making TRAPPIST-1 the flattest planetary system in
the NASA Exoplanet Archive.[96] The orbits are highly circular, with minimal
eccentricities[v][89] and are well-aligned with the spin axis of TRAPPIST-1.[98]
The planets orbit in the same plane and, from the perspective of the Solar
System, transit TRAPPIST-1 during their orbit[99] and frequently pass in front
of each other.[100]

Size and composition

+1.5

The radii of the planets are estimated to range between 77.5−1.4 and 112.9−1.3%
of Earth's radius.[101] The planets:star mass ratio of the TRAPPIST-1 system resembles that of the moons:planet ratio of the
Solar System's gas giants.[102]
The TRAPPIST-1 planets are expected to have compositions that resemble each other[103] as well as that of Earth.[104] The
estimated densities of the planets are lower than Earth's[34] which may imply that they have large amounts of volatile
chemicals.[w] Alternatively, their cores may be smaller than that of Earth;[106] or include large amounts of elements other
than iron;[107] or their iron may exist in an oxidised form rather than as a core;[106] or they may be rocky planets with less
iron than that of Earth.[108] Their densities are too low for a pure magnesium silicate composition,[x] requiring the presence
of lower-density compounds such as water.[110][111] Planets b, d, f, g and h are expected to contain large quantities of
volatile chemicals.[112] The planets may have deep atmospheres and oceans, and contain vast amounts of ice.[113] Several
compositions are possible considering the large uncertainties in their densities.[114] The photospheric features of the star
may introduce inaccuracies in measurements of the properties of TRAPPIST-1's planets,[68] including their densities being
+20

underestimated by 8 -7 percent,[115] and incorrect estimates of their water content.[116]

Resonance and tides
The planets are in orbital resonances.[117] The durations of their orbits have ratios of 8:5, 5:3, 3:2, 3:2, 4:3 and 3:2 between
neighbouring planet pairs,[118] and each set of three is in a Laplace resonance.[y][89] Simulations have shown such
resonances can remain stable over billions of years but that their stability is strongly dependent on initial conditions. Many
configurations become unstable after less than a million years. The resonances enhance the exchange of angular
momentum between the planets, resulting in measurable variations – earlier or later – in their transit times in front of

TRAPPIST-1. These variations yield information on the planetary
system,[120] such as the masses of the planets, when other techniques
are not available.[121] The resonances and the proximity to the host star
have led to comparisons between the TRAPPIST-1 system and the
Galilean moons of Jupiter.[99] Kepler-223 is another exoplanet system
with a TRAPPIST-1-like long resonance.[122]
The mutual interactions of the planets could prevent them from
reaching full synchronisation, which would have important implications
1:32
for the planets' climates. These interactions could force periodic or
episodic full rotations of the planets' surfaces with respect to the star on
Animation of TRAPPIST-1 exoplanets transiting their
timescales of several Earth years.[123] Vinson, Tamayo and Hansen
host star, with effects on the star's light curve.
(2019) found the planets TRAPPIST-1d, e and f likely have chaotic
rotations due to mutual interactions, preventing them from becoming
synchronised to their star. Lack of synchronisation potentially makes the planets more habitable.[124] Other processes that
can prevent synchronous rotation are torques induced by stable triaxial deformation of the planets,[z] which would allow
them to enter 3:2 resonances.[126]
The closeness of the planets to TRAPPIST-1 results in tidal interactions[127] stronger than those on Earth.[128] All the
planets have reached an equilibrium with slow planetary rotations and tidal locking,[127] which can lead to the
synchronisation of a planet's rotation to its revolution around its star.[aa][130]
The planets are likely to undergo substantial tidal heating[131] due to deformations arising from their orbital eccentricities
and gravitational interactions with one another.[132] Such heating would facilitate volcanism and degassing[ab] especially on
the innermost planets, with degassing facilitating the establishment of atmospheres.[134] According to Luger et al. (2017),
tidal heating of the four innermost planets is expected to be greater than Earth's inner heat flux.[135] For the outer planets
Quick et al. (2020) noted that their tidal heating could be comparable to that in the Solar System bodies Europa,
Enceladus, and Triton.[136]
Tidal heating could influence temperatures of the night sides and cold areas where volatiles may be trapped, and gases are
expected to accumulate; it would also influence the properties of any subsurface oceans[137] where volcanism and
hydrothermal venting[ac] could occur.[139] It may further be sufficient to melt the mantles of the four innermost planets, in
whole or in part,[140] potentially forming subsurface magma oceans.[141] This heat source is likely dominant over
radioactive decay, both of which have substantial uncertainties and are considerably less than the stellar radiation
received.[142] Intense tides could fracture the planets' crusts even if they are not sufficiently strong to trigger the onset of
plate tectonics.[143] Tides can also occur in the planetary atmospheres.[144]

Skies and impact of stellar light
Because most of TRAPPIST-1's radiation is in the
infrared region, there may be very little visible light on
the planets' surfaces; Amaury Triaud, one of the system's
co-discoverers, said the skies would never be brighter
than Earth's sky at sunset[146] and only a little brighter
than a night with a full moon. Ignoring atmospheric
effects, illumination would be orange-red.[147] All of the
planets would be visible from each other and would, in
many cases, appear larger than Earth's Moon in the sky
of Earth;[26] observers on TRAPPIST-1e, f and g,
however, could never experience a total stellar eclipse.
[ae][84] Assuming the existence of atmospheres, the star's
long-wavelength radiation would be absorbed to a

greater degree by water and carbon dioxide than sunlight
compared to the inner planets of the Solar System
on Earth; it would also be scattered less by the
atmosphere[148] and less reflected by ice,[149] although
the development of highly reflective hydrohalite ice may negate this effect.[150] The same amount of radiation results in a
warmer planet compared to Sun-like irradiation;[148] more radiation would be absorbed by the planets' upper atmosphere
than by the lower layers, making the atmosphere more stable and less prone to convection.[151]

Habitable zone
For a dim star like TRAPPIST-1, the habitable zone[af] is
located closer to the star than for the Sun.[152] Three or
four[57] planets might be located in the habitable zone;
these include e, f, and g;[152] or d, e, and f.[74] As of 2017,
this is the largest-known number of planets within the
habitable zone of any known star or star system.[153] The
presence of liquid water on any of the planets depends
on several other factors, such as albedo (reflectivity),[154]
the presence of an atmosphere[155] and any greenhouse
effect.[156] Surface conditions are difficult to constrain
without

of

heated to halt the progress of glaciation.[157] Other
factors for the occurrence of liquid water include the
presence of oceans and vegetation;[158] the reflective properties of the land surface; the configuration of continents and
oceans;[159] the presence of clouds;[160] and sea ice dynamics.[161] The effects of volcanic activity may extend the system's
habitable zone to TRAPPIST-1h.[162]
Intense extreme ultraviolet (XUV) and X-ray radiation[163] can split water into its component parts of hydrogen and
oxygen, and heat the upper atmosphere until they escape from the planet. This was thought to have been particularly
important early in the star's history, when radiation was more intense and could have heated every planet's water to its
boiling point.[149] This process is believed to have removed water from Venus.[164] In the case of TRAPPIST-1, different
studies with different assumptions on the kinetics, energetics, and XUV emissions have come to different conclusions on
whether any TRAPPIST-1 planet may retain substantial amounts of water. Because the planets are most likely synchronised
to their host star, any water present could become trapped on the planets' night sides and would be unavailable to support
life unless heat transport by the atmosphere[165] or tidal heating are intense enough to melt ice.[166]

Moons
No moons with a size comparable to Earth's have been detected in the TRAPPIST-1 system,[167] and they are unlikely in
such a densely packed planetary system. This is because moons would likely be either destroyed by their planet's gravity
after entering its Roche limit[ag] or stripped from the planet by leaving its Hill radius[ah][170] Although the TRAPPIST-1
planets appear in an analysis of potential exomoon hosts, they do not appear in the list of habitable-zone exoplanets that
could host a moon for at least one Hubble time,[171] a timeframe slightly longer than the current age of the Universe.[172]
Despite these factors, it is possible the planets could host moons.[173]

Magnetic effects
The TRAPPIST-1 planets are expected to be within the Alfvén surface of their host star,[174] the area around the star within
which any planet would directly magnetically interact with the corona of the star, possibly destabilising any atmosphere the
planet has.[175] Stellar energetic particles would not create a substantial radiation hazard for organisms on TRAPPIST-1
planets if atmospheres reached pressures of about 1 bar.[176] Estimates of radiation fluxes have considerable uncertainties
due to the lack of knowledge about the structure of TRAPPIST-1's magnetic field.[177] Induction heating from the star's
time-varying electrical and magnetic fields[140][178] may occur on its planets[179] but this would make no substantial
contribution to their energy balance[142] and is vastly exceeded by tidal heating.[136]

Formation history
The TRAPPIST-1 planets most likely formed further from the star and migrated inwards,[180] although it is possible they
formed in their current locations.[181] According to Ormel et al. (2017), the planets formed when a streaming instability[ai]
at the water-ice line gave rise to precursor bodies, which accumulated additional fragments and migrated inwards,
eventually giving rise to planets.[183] The migration may initially have been fast and later slowed,[184] and tidal effects may
have further influenced the formation processes.[185] The distribution of the fragments would have controlled the final

mass of the planets, which would consist of approximately 10% water consistent with observational inference.[183]
Resonant chains of planets like those of TRAPPIST-1 usually become unstable when the gas disk that gave rise to them
dissipates, but in this case, the planets remained in resonance.[186] The resonance may have been either present from the
system's formation and was preserved when the planets simultaneously moved inwards,[187] or it might have formed later
when inward-migrating planets accumulated at the outer edge of the gas disk and interacted with each other.[181] Inwardmigrating planets would contain substantial amounts of water – too much for it to entirely escape – whereas planets that
formed in their current location would most likely lose all water.[188][189] According to Flock et al. (2019), the orbital
distance of the innermost planet TRAPPIST-1b is consistent with the expected radius of an inward-moving planet around a
star that was one order of magnitude brighter in the past,[190] and with the cavity in the protoplanetary disc created by
TRAPPIST-1's magnetic field.[191] Alternatively, TRAPPIST-1h may have formed in or close to its current location.[192]
The presence of other bodies and planetesimals early in the system's history would have destabilised the TRAPPIST-1
planets' resonance if the bodies were massive enough.[193] Raymond et al. (2021) concluded the TRAPPIST-1 planets
assembled in 1–2 million years, after which time little additional mass was accreted.[194] This would limit any late delivery
of water to the planets[195] and also implies the planets cleared the neighbourhood[aj] of any additional material.[196] The
lack of giant impact events (the rapid formation of the planets would have quickly exhausted pre-planetary material) would
help the planets preserve their volatile materials.[197]
Due to a combination of high insolation, the greenhouse effect of water vapour atmospheres and remnant heat from the
process of planet assembly, the TRAPPIST-1 planets would likely have initially had molten surfaces. Eventually the surfaces
would cool until the magma oceans solidified, which in the case of TRAPPIST-1b may have taken between a few billions of
years, or a few millions of years. The outer planets would then have become cold enough for water vapour to condense.[198]

List of planets

The TRAPPIST-1 system with distances to scale, compared with the Moon-Earth distance

TRAPPIST-1b
TRAPPIST-1b has a semi-major axis of 0.0115 astronomical units (1,720,000 km)[199] and an orbital period of 1.51 Earth
days. It is expected to be tidally locked to its star. The planet is outside the habitable zone;[200] its expected irradiation is
more than four times that of Earth.[200] TRAPPIST-1b has a slightly larger measured radius and mass than Earth but
estimates of its density imply it does not exclusively consist of rock.[201] Owing to its black-body temperature of 124 °C
(397 K), TRAPPIST-1b may have had a runaway greenhouse effect similar to that of Venus;[74] its atmosphere, if present,
may be similarly deep, dense, and hot.[202] Based on several climate models, the planet would have been desiccated by
TRAPPIST-1's stellar wind and radiation;[203][204] it could be quickly losing hydrogen and therefore any hydrogendominated atmosphere.[ak] Water, if any exists, could persist only in specific settings on the planet,[206] whose surface
temperature could be as high as 1,200 °C (1,470 K), making TRAPPIST-1b a candidate magma ocean planet.[207]

TRAPPIST-1c
TRAPPIST-1c has a semi-major axis of 0.0158 AU (2,360,000 km)[199] and orbits its
star every 2.42 Earth days. It is close enough to TRAPPIST-1 to be tidally locked.[200] Its
atmosphere could either be absent or thick like that of Venus.[202] TRAPPIST-1c is
outside the habitable zone[200] as it receives about twice as much stellar irradiation as
Earth[208] and thus either is or has been a runaway greenhouse.[74] Based on several
climate models, the planet would have been desiccated by TRAPPIST-1's stellar wind
and radiation.[203] TRAPPIST-1c could harbour water only in specific settings on its
surface.[206] Observations in 2017 showed no escaping hydrogen,[58] but observations
by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) in 2020 indicated that hydrogen may be escaping
at a rate of 1.4 × 107 g/s.[205]

Infrared measurements by the
NASA / ESA / Canadian Space
Agency / James Webb Space
Telescope of TRAPPIST-1 c
indicate that it is likely not as
Venus-like as once imagined.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRAPPIST-1

TRAPPIST-1d has a semi-major axis of 0.022 AU (3,300,000 km) and an orbital period of 4.05 Earth days. It is more
massive but less dense than Mars.[209] Based on fluid dynamical arguments, TRAPPIST-1d is expected to have weak
temperature gradients on its surface if it is tidally locked,[210] and may have significantly different stratospheric dynamics
than that of Earth.[211] Several climate models suggest that the planet may[203] or may not have been desiccated by
TRAPPIST-1's stellar wind and radiation;[203] density estimates, if confirmed, indicate it is not dense enough to consist
solely of rock.[201] The current state of TRAPPIST-1d depends on its rotation and climatic factors like cloud feedback;
[al][202] it is close to the inner edge of the habitable zone, but the existence of either liquid water or alternatively a runaway
greenhouse effect (that would render it uninhabitable) are dependent on detailed atmospheric conditions.[213] Water could
persist in specific settings on the planet.[206]

TRAPPIST-1e
TRAPPIST-1e has a semi-major axis of 0.029 AU (4,300,000 km)[199] and orbits its star every 6.10 Earth days.[214] It has
density similar that of Earth.[215] Based on several climate models, the planet is the most likely of the system to have
retained its water,[203] and the most likely to have liquid water for many climate states. A dedicated climate model project
called TRAPPIST-1 Habitable Atmosphere Intercomparison (THAI) has been launched to study its potential climate
states.[216] Based on observations of its Lyman-alpha radiation emissions, TRAPPIST-1e may be losing hydrogen at a rate
of 0.6 × 107 g/s.[205]
TRAPPIST-1e is in a comparable position within the habitable zone to that of Proxima Centauri b,[am][218][219] which also
has an Earth-like density.[215] TRAPPIST-1e could have retained masses of water equivalent to several of Earth's oceans.[74]
Moderate quantities of carbon dioxide could warm TRAPPIST-1e to temperatures suitable for the presence of liquid
water.[204]

TRAPPIST-1f
TRAPPIST-1f has a semi-major axis of 0.038 AU (5,700,000 km)[199] and orbits its star every 9.21 Earth days.[214] It is
likely too distant from its host star to sustain liquid water, being instead an entirely glaciated snowball planet.[203]
Moderate quantities of CO2 could warm TRAPPIST-1f to temperatures suitable for the presence of liquid water.[206]
TRAPPIST-1f may have retained masses of water equivalent to several of Earth's oceans[74] and which could comprise up to
half of the planet's mass;[220] it could thus be an ocean planet.[an][222]

TRAPPIST-1g
TRAPPIST-1g has a semi-major axis of 0.047 AU (7,000,000 km)[199] and orbits its star every 12.4 Earth days.[214] It is
likely too distant from its host star to sustain liquid water, being instead a snowball planet.[203] Moderate quantities of
CO2[206] or internal heat from radioactive decay and tidal heating may warm its surface to above the melting point of
water.[223] TRAPPIST-1g may have retained masses of water equivalent to several of Earth's oceans;[74] density estimates of
the planet, if confirmed, indicate it is not dense enough to consist solely of rock.[201] Up to half of its mass may be
water.[220]

TRAPPIST-1h
TRAPPIST-1h has a semi-major axis of 0.062 astronomical units (9,300,000 km); it is the system's least massive known
planet[199] and orbits its star every 18.9 Earth days.[214] It is likely too distant from its host star to sustain liquid water and
may be a snowball planet,[203] or have a methane/nitrogen atmosphere resembling that of Titan.[224] Large quantities of
CO2, hydrogen or methane,[225] or internal heat from radioactive decay and tidal heating,[223] would be needed to warm
TRAPPIST-1h to the point where liquid water could exist.[225] TRAPPIST-1h could have retained masses of water
equivalent to several of Earth's oceans.[74]

Potential planetary atmospheres
As of 2020, there is no definitive evidence that any of the TRAPPIST-1 planets have an atmosphere,[ap][228] but
atmospheres could be detected in the future.[229] The outer planets are more likely to have atmospheres than the inner
planets.[180] Several studies have simulated how different atmospheric scenarios would look to observers, and the chemical
processes underpinning these atmospheric compositions.[230] The visibility of an exoplanet and of its atmosphere scale
with the inverse square of the radius of its host star.[229] Detection of individual components of the atmospheres – in
particular CO2, ozone, and water[231] – would also be possible, although different components would require different
conditions and different numbers of transits.[232] A contamination of the atmospheric signals through patterns in the
stellar photosphere is a further impediment to detection.[233]
The existence of atmospheres around TRAPPIST-1's planets depends on the balance between the amount of atmosphere
initially present, its rate of evaporation, and the rate at which it is built back up by meteorite impacts,[89] incoming material
from a protoplanetary disk[aq],[235] and outgassing and volcanic activity.[236] Impact events may be particularly important
in the outer planets because they can both add and remove volatiles; addition is likely dominant in the outermost planets
where impact velocities are slower.[237][238] Although the properties of TRAPPIST-1 are unfavourable to the continued
existence of atmospheres around its planets,[239] the formation conditions of the planets would give them large initial
quantities of volatile materials,[180] including oceans over 100 times larger than those of Earth.[240]
If the planets are tidally locked to TRAPPIST-1, surfaces that permanently face away from the star can cool sufficiently for
any atmosphere to freeze out on the night side.[241] This frozen-out atmosphere could be recycled through glacier-like flows
to the day side with assistance from tidal or geothermal heating from below, or could be stirred by impact events. These

processes could allow an atmosphere to persist.[242] In a carbon dioxide
(CO2) atmosphere, carbon-dioxide ice is denser than water ice, under
which it tends to be buried. CO2-water compounds named clathrates[ar]
can form. Further complications are a potential runaway feedback loop
between melting ice and evaporation, and the greenhouse effect.[244]
Numerical modelling and observations constrain the properties of
hypothetical atmospheres around TRAPPIST-1 planets:[180]
▪ Theoretical calculations[245] and observations have ruled out the
possibility the TRAPPIST-1 planets have hydrogen-rich[222][246] or
helium-rich atmospheres.[247] Hydrogen-rich exospheres[as] may be
detectable[249] but have not been reliably detected,[250] except
perhaps for TRAPPIST-1b and 1c by Bourrier et al. (2017).[192][14]
▪ Water-dominated atmospheres, though suggested by some density
estimates, are improbable for the planets because they are expected
to be unstable under the conditions around TRAPPIST-1, especially

imply they do not have a cloud-free, water-rich atmosphere.[251]

▪ Oxygen-dominated atmospheres can form when radiation splits

water into hydrogen and oxygen, and the hydrogen escapes due to
its lighter mass. The existence of such an atmosphere and its mass
depends on the initial water mass, on whether the oxygen is dragged out of the atmosphere by escaping hydrogen and
of the state of the planet's surface; a partially molten surface could absorb sufficient quantities of oxygen to remove an
atmosphere.[252]
▪ Atmospheres formed by ammonia and/or methane near TRAPPIST-1 would be destroyed by the star's radiation at a
sufficient rate to quickly remove an atmosphere. The rate at which ammonia or methane are produced, possibly by
organisms, would have to be considerably larger than that on Earth to sustain such an atmosphere. It is possible the
development of organic hazes from ammonia or methane photolysis could shield the remaining molecules from
degradation caused by radiation.[253] Ducrot et al. (2020) interpreted observational data as implying methanedominated atmospheres are unlikely around TRAPPIST-1 planets.[254]
▪ Nitrogen-dominated atmospheres are particularly unstable with respect to atmospheric escape, especially on the
innermost planets, although the presence of CO2 may slow evaporation.[255] Unless the TRAPPIST-1 planets initially
contained far more nitrogen than Earth, they are unlikely to have retained such atmospheres.[256]
▪ CO2-dominated atmospheres escape slowly because CO2 effectively radiates away energy and thus does not readily
reach escape velocity; on a synchronously rotating planet, however, CO2 can freeze out on the night side, especially if
there are no other gases in the atmosphere. The decomposition of CO2 caused by radiation could yield substantial
amounts of oxygen, carbon monoxide (CO),[204] and ozone.[257]
Theoretical modelling by Krissansen-Totton and Fortney (2022) suggests the inner planets most likely have oxygen-andCO2-rich atmospheres, if any.[258] If the planets have an atmosphere, the amount of precipitation, its form and location
would be determined by the presence and position of mountains and oceans, and the rotation period.[259] Planets in the
habitable zone are expected to have an atmospheric circulation regime resembling Earth's tropical regions with largely
uniform temperatures.[260] Whether greenhouse gases can accumulate on the outer TRAPPIST-1 planets in sufficient
quantities to warm them to the melting point of water is controversial; on a synchronously rotating planet, CO2 could freeze
and precipitate on the night side, and ammonia and methane would be destroyed by XUV radiation from TRAPPIST-1.[74]
Carbon dioxide freezing-out can occur only on the outermost planets unless special conditions are met, and other volatiles
do not freeze out.[261]

Stability
The emission of extreme ultraviolet (XUV) radiation by a star has an important influence on the stability of its planets'
atmospheres, their composition and the habitability of their surfaces.[261] It can cause the ongoing removal of atmospheres
from planets.[89] XUV radiation-induced atmospheric escape has been observed on gas giants.[262] M dwarfs emit large
amounts of XUV radiation;[261] TRAPPIST-1 and the Sun emit about the same amount of XUV radiation[at] and because
TRAPPIST-1's planets are much closer to the star than the Sun's, they receive much more intense irradiation.[55]
TRAPPIST-1 has been emitting radiation for much longer than the Sun.[264] The process of atmospheric escape has been
modelled mainly in the context of hydrogen-rich atmospheres and little quantitative research has been done on those of

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRAPPIST-1

other compositions such as water and CO2.[246]
TRAPPIST-1 has moderate to high stellar activity[au],[32]
and this may be another difficulty for the persistence of
atmospheres and water on the planets:[27]
▪ Dwarfs of the spectral class M have intense
flares;[261] TRAPPIST-1 averages about 0.38 flares
per day[74] and four to six superflares[av] per
year.[267] Such flares would have only small impacts
on atmospheric temperatures but would substantially
affect the stability and chemistry of atmospheres.[89]
According to Samara, Patsourakos and Georgoulis
Observed brightness of the TRAPPIST-1 star, showing large variation in
(2021), the TRAPPIST-1 planets are unlikely to be
brightness. The graph displays dips, indicating the transit of exoplanets.

ejections.[268]
▪ The stellar wind from TRAPPIST-1 may have a
pressure 1,000 times larger than that of the Sun at
Earth's orbit, which could destabilise atmospheres of the star's planets[269] up to planet f. The pressure would push the
wind deep into the atmospheres,[203] facilitating loss of water and evaporation of the atmospheres.[89][224] Stellar winddriven escape in the Solar System is largely independent from planetary properties such as mass;[270] stellar wind from
TRAPPIST-1 could remove the atmospheres of its planets on a timescale of 100 million to 10 billion years.[271]
▪ Ohmic heating[aw] of the atmosphere of TRAPPIST-1e, f, and g amounts to 5–15 times the heating from XUV radiation;
if the heat is effectively absorbed, it could destabilise the atmospheres.[273]
The star's history also influences the atmospheres of its planets.[274] Immediately after its formation, TRAPPIST-1 would
have been in a pre-main-sequence state, which may have lasted between hundreds of millions[261] and two billion
years.[233] While in this state, it would have been considerably brighter than it is today and the star's intense irradiation
would have impacted the atmospheres of surrounding planets, vaporising all common volatiles such as ammonia, CO2,
sulfur dioxide, and water.[275] Thus, all of the system's planets would have been heated to a runaway greenhouse[ax] for at
least part of their existence.[261] The XUV radiation would have been even higher during the pre-main-sequence stage.[89]

Possible life
Life may be possible in the TRAPPIST-1 system, and some of the star's planets are considered promising targets for its
detection.[27] On the basis of atmospheric stability, TRAPPIST-1e is theoretically the planet most likely to harbour life; the
probability that it does is considerably less than that of Earth. There are an array of factors at play:[276][277]
▪ Due to multiple interactions, TRAPPIST-1 planets are expected to have intense tides.[278] If oceans are present,[ay] the
tides could: lead to alternate flooding and drying of coastal landscapes triggering chemical reactions conducive to the
development of life;[280] favour the evolution of biological rhythms such as the day-night cycle that otherwise would not
develop in a synchronously rotating planet;[281] mix oceans, thus supplying and redistributing nutrients;[282] and
stimulate periodic expansions of marine organisms similar to red tides on Earth.[283]
▪ TRAPPIST-1 may not produce sufficient quantities of radiation for photosynthesis to support an Earth-like biosphere.
[284][285][286] Mullan and Bais (2018) speculated that radiation from flares may increase the photosynthetic potential of
TRAPPIST-1,[287] but according to Lingam and Loeb (2019), the potential would still be small.[288]
▪ Due to the proximity of the TRAPPIST-1 planets, it is possible rock-encased microorganisms ripped[az] from one planet
may arrive at another planet while still viable inside the rock, allowing life to spread between the planets if it originates
on one.[289]
▪ Too much UV radiation from a star can sterilise the surface of a planet[111][152] but too little may not allow the formation
of chemical compounds that give rise to life.[14][290] Inadequate production of hydroxyl radicals by low stellar-UV
emission may allow gases such as carbon monoxide that are toxic to higher life to accumulate in the planets'
atmospheres.[291] The possibilities range from UV fluxes from TRAPPIST-1 being unlikely to be much larger than these
of early Earth – even in the event that TRAPPIST-1's emissions of UV radiation are high[292] – to being sufficient to
sterilise the planets if they do not have protective atmospheres.[293] As of 2020 it is unclear which effect would
predominate around TRAPPIST-1,[233] although observations with the Kepler Space Telescope and the Evryscope
telescopes indicate the UV flux may be insufficient for the formation of life or its sterilisation. [267]
▪ The outer planets in the TRAPPIST-1 system could host subsurface oceans similar to those of Enceladus and Europa

11/15/2023, 8:12 PM

in the Solar System.[294] Chemolithotrophy, the growth of organisms based on non-organic reduced compounds,[295]
could sustain life in such oceans.[139] Very deep oceans may be inimical to the development of life.[296]
▪ Some planets of the TRAPPIST-1 system may have enough water to completely submerge their surfaces.[297] If so, this
would have important effects on the possibility of life developing on the planets, and on their climates,[298] as
weathering would decrease, starving the oceans of nutrients like phosphorus as well as potentially leading to the
accumulation of carbon dioxide in their atmospheres.[299]
In 2017, a search for technosignatures that would indicate the existence of past or present technology in the TRAPPIST-1
system found only signals coming from Earth.[300] In less than two millennia, Earth will be transiting in front of the Sun
from the viewpoint of TRAPPIST-1, making the detection of life on Earth from TRAPPIST-1 possible.[301]

Reception and scientific importance
Public reaction and cultural impact
The discovery of the TRAPPIST-1 planets drew widespread attention in major world
newspapers, social media, streaming television and websites.[302][303] As of 2017, the
discovery of TRAPPIST-1 led to the largest single-day web traffic to the NASA
website.[304] NASA started a public campaign on Twitter to find names for the planets,
which drew responses of varying seriousness, although the names of the planets will be
decided by the International Astronomical Union.[305] The dynamics of the TRAPPIST-1
planetary system have been represented as music, such as Tim Pyle's Trappist
Transits,[306] in Isolation's single Trappist-1 (A Space Anthem)[307] and Leah Asher's
piano work TRAPPIST-1.[308] The alleged discovery of an SOS signal from TRAPPIST-1
was an April Fools prank by researchers at the High Energy Stereoscopic System in
Namibia.[309] In 2018, Aldo Spadon created a giclée (digital artwork) named
"TRAPPIST-1 Planetary System as seen from Space".[310] A website was dedicated to the
TRAPPIST-1 system.[311]

Kepler image of TRAPPIST-1

Exoplanets are often featured in science-fiction works; books, comics and video games
have featured the TRAPPIST-1 system, the earliest being The Terminator, a short story
by Swiss author Laurence Suhner published in the academic journal that announced the
system's discovery.[312] At least one conference was organised to recognise works of
fiction featuring TRAPPIST-1.[313] The planets have been used as the basis of science
education competitions[314] and school projects.[315][316] Websites offering TRAPPIST1-like planets as settings of virtual reality simulations exist,[317] such as the "Exoplanet
Travel Bureau"[318] and the "Exoplanets Excursion" – both by NASA.[319] Scientific
accuracy has been a point of discussion for such cultural depictions of TRAPPIST-1
planets.[320]

the small size of their host star, and because from Earth's perspective they frequently
pass in front of their host star.[33] Future observations with space-based observatories
and ground-based facilities may allow further insights into their properties such as density, atmospheres, and
biosignatures.[ba] TRAPPIST-1 planets[322][323] are considered an important observation target for the James Webb Space
Telescope (JWST)[bb][228] and other telescopes under construction.[158] Together with the discovery of Proxima Centauri b,
the discovery of the TRAPPIST-1 planets and the fact that three of the planets are within the habitable zone has led to an
increase in studies on planetary habitability.[326] The planets are considered prototypical for the research on habitability of
M dwarfs.[327] The star has been the subject of detailed studies[104] of its various aspects[328] including the possible effects
of vegetation on its planets; the possibility of detecting oceans on its planets using starlight reflected off their surfaces;[329]
possible efforts to terraform its planets;[330] and difficulties any inhabitants of the planets would encounter with
discovering the law of gravitation[331] and with interstellar travel.[332]

The role EU funding played in the discovery of TRAPPIST-1 has been cited as an example of the importance of EU

projects,[35] and the involvement of a Moroccan observatory as an indication of the Arab world's role in science. The
original discoverers were affiliated with universities spanning Africa, Europe, and North America,[333] and the discovery of
TRAPPIST-1 is considered to be an example of the importance of co-operation between observatories.[334] It is also one of
the major astronomical discoveries from Chilean observatories.[335]

Exploration
TRAPPIST-1 is too distant from Earth to be reached by humans with current or expected technology.[336] Spacecraft
mission designs using present-day rockets and gravity assists would need hundreds of millennia to reach TRAPPIST-1;
even a theoretical interstellar probe travelling at the speed of light would need decades to reach the star. The speculative
Breakthrough Starshot proposal for sending small, laser-accelerated, uncrewed probes would require around two centuries
to reach TRAPPIST-1.[337]

TW Hydrae
TW Hydrae is a T Tauri star approximately 196
light-years away[1] in the constellation of Hydra
(the Sea Serpent). TW Hydrae is about 80% of the
mass of the Sun, but is only about 5-10 million
years old. The star appears to be accreting from a
face-on protoplanetary disk of dust and gas,
which has been resolved in images from the
ALMA observatory. TW Hydrae is accompanied
by about twenty other low-mass stars with similar
ages and spatial motions, comprising the "TW
Hydrae association" or TWA, one of the closest
regions of recent "fossil" star-formation to the
Sun.

TW Hydrae is a pre-main-sequence star that is
approximately 80% the mass of and 111% the
radius of the Sun. It has a temperature of 4000 K
and is about 8 million years old. In comparison,
the Sun is about 4.6 billion years old[7] and has a
temperature of 5778 K.[8] The star's luminosity is
28% (0.28x) that of the Sun, equivalent to that of
a main-sequence star of spectral type ~K2.
However, the spectral class is K6.
The star's apparent magnitude, or how bright it
appears from Earth's perspective, is 11.27. It is
too dim to be seen with the naked eye.

Protoplanetary disk
Previously disproven protoplanet
In December 2007, a team led by Johny Setiawan of the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in
Heidelberg, Germany announced discovery of a planet orbiting TW Hydrae, dubbed "TW Hydrae
b" with a minimum mass around 1.2 Jupiter masses, a period of 3.56 days, and an orbital radius of
0.04 astronomical units (inside the inner rim of the protoplanetary disk). Assuming it orbits in the
same plane as the outer part of the dust disk (inclination 7±1°[10]), it has a true mass of 9.8±3.3
Jupiter masses.[10][11] However, if the inclination is similar to the inner part of the dust disk
+5

(4.3±1.0°[12]), the mass would be 16−3 Jupiter masses, making it a brown dwarf.[12] Since the star
itself is so young, it was presumed this is the youngest extrasolar planet yet discovered, and
essentially still in formation.[13]

In 2008 a team of Spanish researchers concluded that the planet does not exist: the radial velocity
variations were not consistent when observed at different wavelengths, which would not occur if
the origin of the radial velocity variations was caused by an orbiting planet. Instead, the data was
better modelled by starspots on TW Hydrae's surface passing in and out of view as the star rotates.
"Results support the spot scenario rather than the presence of a hot Jupiter around TW Hya".[14]
Similar wavelength-dependent radial velocity variations, also caused by starspots, have been
detected on other T Tauri stars.[15]
New study of more distant planet
In 2016, ALMA found evidence that a possible Neptune-like planet was forming in its disk, at a
distance of around 22 AU.[16]

In 2016, methanol, one of the building blocks for life, was detected in the star's protoplanetary

Coordinates:

01h 37m 25s, −45° 40′ 41″

WASP-18b is an exoplanet that is notable for having an
orbital period of less than one day. It has a mass equal to
10 Jupiter masses,[1] just below the boundary line
between planets and brown dwarfs (about 13 Jupiter
masses). Due to tidal deceleration, it is expected to spiral
toward and eventually merge with its host star, WASP-18,
in less than a million years.[1] The planet is
approximately 3.1 million km (1.9 million mi; 0.021 AU)
from its star, which is about 400 light-years (120
parsecs) from Earth. A team led by Coel Hellier, a
professor of astrophysics at Keele University in England,
discovered the exoplanet in 2009.[1]
Scientists at Keele and at the University of Maryland are
working to understand whether the discovery of this
planet so shortly before its expected demise (with less
than 0.1% of its lifetime remaining) was fortuitous, or
whether tidal dissipation by WASP-18 is actually much
less efficient than astrophysicists typically assume.[1][5]
Observations made over the next decade should yield a
measurement of the rate at which WASP-18b's orbit is
decaying.[6]

WASP-39b, officially named Bocaprins, is a "hot Jupiter"
extrasolar planet discovered in February 2011[3] by the WASP
project, notable for containing a substantial amount of water in
its atmosphere.[1][4][5] In addition WASP-39b was the first
exoplanet found to contain carbon dioxide in its atmosphere,
[6][7] and likewise for sulfur dioxide.
WASP-39b is in the constellation Virgo, and is about 700 lightyears from Earth.[1] As part of the NameExoWorlds campaigns
at the 100th anniversary of the IAU, the planet was named
Bocaprins, after the beach Boca Prins in the Arikok National
Park of Aruba.

WASP-39b is also notable for having an extremely low density, near that of WASP-17b. While
WASP-17b has a density of 0.13 ± 0.06 g/cm3, WASP-39b has a slightly higher density of
0.18 ± 0.04 g/cm3.

Atmospheric composition
Hot water molecules were found in the atmosphere of
WASP-39b in a 2018 study.[1] The atmospheric transmission
spectra, taken by different instruments, were inconsistent as in
2021, possibly indicating a disequilibrium atmospheric
chemistry.[8] High-fidelity spectra obtained by the James Webb
Space Telescope in 2022 did not confirm a disequilibrium
chemistry.
WASP-39b's atmospheric
transmission spectrum captured by
Webb’s Near-Infrared Spectrograph
(NIRSpec) reveals first clear
evidence for carbon dioxide in a
planet outside the Solar System.[6]

WASP-39b is one of the James Webb Space Telescope's early
release science targets. Sulfur dioxide was observed in this
planet's atmosphere for the first time, or indeed of any planet
outside of the Solar System, indicating the existence of
photochemical processes in the atmosphere.[9] WASP-39b is
the first exoplanet in which carbon dioxide has been detected.
[6][10][7]

Planetary transmission spectra taken in 2022 has indicated the atmosphere of WASP-39b is
partially cloudy, and planet C/O ratio appears to be subsolar.[11] The spectral signature of water,
carbon dioxide, sodium[12] and sulfur dioxide were also detected.[13]

WASP-39 (star)
The parent star WASP-39 is of spectral class G
and is slightly smaller than the Sun. It lies in the
Virgo constellation, 698 light-years from
Earth.[1] The star WASP-39 was named Malmok.

WASP-43b
WASP-43b, formally named Astrolábos,[3] is a transiting
planet in orbit around the young, active, and low-mass star
WASP-43 in the constellation Sextans. The planet is a hot
Jupiter with a mass twice that of Jupiter, but with a roughly
equal radius. WASP-43b was flagged as a candidate by the
SuperWASP program, before they conducted follow-ups using
instruments at La Silla Observatory in Chile, which confirmed
its existence and provided orbital and physical characteristics.
The planet's discovery was published on April 14, 2011.[2]
At the time of its discovery, WASP-43b had an orbital period of
approximately 0.8 days (19.2 hours), the second-shortest orbit
ever detected, surpassed only by WASP-19b.[2] In addition, at
the time of discovery, WASP-43b was the most closely orbiting
hot Jupiter known,[2] a phenomenon that can most likely be
explained by its host star's low mass.

Nomenclature
In August 2022, this planet and its host star were included
among 20 systems to be named by the third NameExoWorlds
project.[7] The approved names, proposed by a team from
Romania, were announced in June 2023. WASP-43b is named
Astrolábos and its host star is named Gnomon, after the
gnomon and the Greek word for the astrolabe.[3]

Observational history
WASP-43 was first flagged as host to a potential transiting
event (when a body crosses in front of and dims its host star)
by data collected by SuperWASP, a British organization
working to discover transiting planets across the entirety of the
sky. In particular, WASP-43 was observed first by the leg of
WASP-South at the South African Astronomical Observatory
between January and May 2009.[2]
Later observation by both SuperWASPs in the Northern and
Southern Hemispheres led to the collection of 13,768 data
points between January and May 2010 and to the use of the
CORALIE spectrograph at La Silla Observatory in Chile.

Fourteen measurements using the radial velocity method
confirmed WASP-43b as a planet, revealing its mass in the
process. The use of La Silla's TRAPPIST telescope helped the
science team working on the planet to create a light curve of
the planet's transit in December 2010.[2]
The planet's discovery was published in the journal Astronomy
and Astrophysics on April 14, 2011.[2]

Host star
WASP-43 is a K-type star in the Sextans constellation that is about 80 parsecs (261 light years)
away.[2] The star has a mass 0.58 times that of the Sun, but is more diffuse, with a radius 0.93
times that of the Sun. The star's effective temperature is 4,400 K, making the star cooler than the
Sun, and is metal-poor with regards to the Sun because it has a metallicity of [Fe/H] = −0.05 (89%
the amount of iron in the Sun).[5] The star is young, and is estimated to be 598 million years old (as
compared to the Sun's 4.6 billion years).[5] Analysis of emission lines indicate that WASP-43 is an
active star.[2]
WASP-43 has one detected planet in its orbit, WASP-43b. The star has an apparent magnitude of
12.4, and thus is too faint to be seen with the unaided eye from Earth.[5]

Characteristics
WASP-43b is a dense hot Jupiter with a mass 2.05 times the mass of Jupiter, but a radius 1.036
times that of Jupiter's. The planet orbits its host star at a mean distance of 0.01526 AU every
0.813478 days (19.5235 hours);[5] this orbital period, at the time of WASP-43b's discovery, was the
second-shortest orbit yet detected, surpassed only by WASP-19b. In comparison, Mercury has an
orbital period of 87.97 days and lies at a mean distance of 0.387 AU from the Sun.[10] In addition,
WASP-43b had the closest orbit to its host star (among hot Jupiters) at the time of its discovery,
comparable only to the super-Earth planet GJ 1214 b and to the planetary candidate orbiting
KOI-961 (confirmed a year later as Kepler-42). While hot Jupiters are known to have small orbital
periods, planets with exceptionally small periods below three or four days are extremely rare;
however, in the case of WASP-43b, the planet's proximity can be explained because its host star
has a very low mass. The rarity of systems like that of WASP-43 and its planet suggest that hot
Jupiters do not usually occur around low-mass stars, or that such planets cannot maintain stable
orbits around such stars.[2]
WASP-43b, along with the planets WASP-19b and WASP-18b, conflicted with currently accepted
models of tidal movements derived from observations of the orbits of binary star systems.
Revisions to the model with regard to planets were proposed to help the models conform to the
orbital parameters of these planets.[2] No orbital decay driven by tidal dissipation was detected in
2016, placing a lower limit of 10 million years on the remaining planetary lifetime.[11] Updated
orbital period measurements have failed to detect orbital decay as of 2021.[12][13]

Atmosphere
In 2019, the spectrum of WASP-43b was taken, with the best fit being water-containing clouds
without significant amounts of alkali metals.[14] In 2020, further analysis of the spectra revealed
the presence of bivalent aluminum oxide (AlO) and water in the atmosphere,[15] while carbon
monoxide, carbon dioxide and methane were not detected. Climate modelling suggests the carbon
monoxide concentration may be variable, while the atmospheric spectrum of WASP-43b is
dominated by clouds made of refractory mineral particles, with a small contribution from
hydrocarbon haze.[16] Carbon to oxygen ratio in the planet (0.75 ± 0.15) is elevated compared to
the Solar ratio of 0.55.[17] The planet is very dark overall, with no clouds on the dayside[18] and an
albedo below 0.06.[6]
There is a large difference in temperature between dayside (1479 ± 13 K) and nightside (755 ± 46
K).[18]
