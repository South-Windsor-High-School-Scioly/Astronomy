T Tauri star
T Tauri stars (TTS) are a class of variable stars that are less than
about ten million years old.[1] This class is named after the
prototype, T Tauri, a young star in the Taurus star-forming region.
They are found near molecular clouds and identified by their
optical variability and strong chromospheric lines. T Tauri stars
are pre-main-sequence stars in the process of contracting to the
main sequence along the Hayashi track, a luminosity–temperature
relationship obeyed by infant stars of less than 3 solar masses
(M ) in the pre-main-sequence phase of 
☉ stellar evolution.[2] It Artist's impression of a T Tauri star

ends when a star of 0.5 M☉ or larger develops a radiative zone, or with a circumstellar accretion disc
when a smaller star commences nuclear fusion on the main
sequence.

History
While T Tauri itself was discovered in 1852, the T Tauri class of stars were initially defined by Alfred
Harrison Joy in 1945.[3]

Characteristics
T Tauri stars comprise the youngest visible F, G, K and M spectral type stars (<2 M☉). Their surface
temperatures are similar to those of main-sequence stars of the same mass, but they are significantly more
luminous because their radii are larger. Their central temperatures are too low for hydrogen fusion.
Instead, they are powered by gravitational energy released as the stars contract, while moving towards the
main sequence, which they reach after about 100 million years. They typically rotate with a period
between one and twelve days, compared to a month for the Sun, and are very active and variable.

There is evidence of large areas of starspot coverage, and they have intense and variable X-ray and radio
emissions (approximately 1000 times that of the Sun). Many have extremely powerful stellar winds;
some eject gas in high-velocity bipolar jets. Another source of brightness variability are clumps
(protoplanets and planetesimals) in the disk surrounding T Tauri stars.

Their spectra show a higher lithium abundance than the Sun and other main-sequence stars because
lithium is destroyed at temperatures above 2,500,000 K. From a study of lithium abundances in 53 T
Tauri stars, it has been found that lithium depletion varies strongly with size, suggesting that "lithium
burning" by the p-p chain during the last highly convective and unstable stages during the later pre–main
sequence phase of the Hayashi contraction may be one of the main sources of energy for T Tauri stars.
Rapid rotation tends to improve mixing and increase the transport of lithium into deeper layers where it is
destroyed. T Tauri stars generally increase their rotation rates as they age, through contraction and spin-



up, as they conserve angular momentum. This causes an increased rate of
lithium loss with age. Lithium burning will also increase with higher
temperatures and mass, and will last for at most a little over 100 million
years.

The p-p chain for lithium burning is as follows

Types
Several types of TTSs exist:[4]

Classical T Tauri star (CTTS)
Weak-line T Tauri star (WTTS)

Naked T Tauri star (NTTS), which is a subset of WTTS.
Roughly half of T Tauri stars have circumstellar disks, which
in this case are called protoplanetary discs because they are
probably the progenitors of planetary systems like the Solar
System. Circumstellar discs are estimated to dissipate on
timescales of up to 10 million years. Most T Tauri stars are in
binary star systems. In various stages of their life, they are
called young stellar object (YSOs). It is thought that the
active magnetic fields and strong solar wind of Alfvén waves
of T Tauri stars are one means by which angular momentum

Protoplanetary discs in the Orion Nebula gets transferred from the star to the protoplanetary disc. A T
Tauri stage for the Solar System would be one means by
which the angular momentum of the contracting Sun was

transferred to the protoplanetary disc and hence, eventually to the planets.



Analogs of T Tauri stars in the higher mass range (2–8 solar masses)—A and B spectral type pre–main-
sequence stars, are called Herbig Ae/Be-type stars. More massive (>8 solar masses) stars in pre–main
sequence stage are not observed, because they evolve very quickly: when they become visible (i.e.
disperses surrounding circumstellar gas and dust cloud), the hydrogen in the center is already burning and
they are main sequence objects.

Planets
Planets around T Tauri stars include:
