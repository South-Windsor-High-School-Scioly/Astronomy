“The equations we seek
are the poetry of  nature . . . . 

Why is nature that way? 
Why is it possible for these powerful 

manifestations of  forces to be trapped
in a very simple, beautiful formula?”

“This has been a question
which many people

have discussed,
but there is no answer.”

LAWS !!!

Keys to Understanding 
the Greenhouse Effect

TYING IT ALL TOGETHER:
THE RADIATION “LAWS”

The Sun’s 
energy is 
emitted in the 
form of  
electromagnetic 
radiation. 

mostly SW  (but 
also some LW)





The Earth’s 
energy 
(terrestrial) is 
also emitted in 
the form of  
electromagnetic 
wavelengths.

mostly LW





LAW #1

Emission of  radiation
All substances emit radiation as 
long as their temperature is 
above absolute zero    

(-273.15oC or 0 Kelvin).

p 35



LAW #2 BLACKBODY & 
PLANCK FUNCTION CONCEPT

The Sun is very similar to an 
“ideal emitter”  (or “Black body”)
(NOTE:  the Earth isn’t as ideal as a “black body”

Black body (def): a hypothetical object 
that absorbs all of  the radiation that 
strikes it.  It also emits radiation 
(“Energy flux”) at a maximum rate for its 
given temperature.

p 35



Blackbodies (“ideal emitters”) exhibit a 
defined relationship between:

the intensity of  radiation energy (E)
(i.e. amount of  radiation flux) they give off  

& 
the wavelength of  that radiation. 

This relationship is called the Planck function:

E = h * speed of  light / wavelength

or 

E = h c / λ
(where h is Planck’s constant.) 

p 35



Planck Function:
“I radiate at the 

speed of  light like 

The Sun emits a blackbody; but 
my energy flux is 

energy at ALL GREATEST at 

wavelengths . . . SHORTER  
wavelengths” 

but the amount of  
Energy emitted

is 
inversely related

to the wavelength of  
emission





This can be depicted in a graph:

intensity (radiation flux) 
“peaks” here

 shorter longer 

An emitting blackbody’s SHORTER wavelengths 
have HIGHER intensity radiation (and greater 
energy flux) than the LONGER wavelengths

p 35



Easy way to remember the 
PLANCK FUNCTION / 

BLACKBODY  concept:

“The shorter the wavelength,
the GREATER the intensity

of  the energy flux”





Q1 - Gamma radiation involves a 
greater energy flux than microwave 

radiation.

1. True

2. False  Record your Q1 
answer now

3. Both wavelength bands 
have the same energy 
flux

4. We haven’t learned 
enough yet to answer 
this!

LAW #3: THE STEFAN-BOLTZMANN 
LAW:

If  the substance is an ideal 
emitter (black body), 

The total AMOUNT of  radiation 
given off  

is proportional
to the fourth power of  

its absolute TEMPERATURE.

p 35



E =     T 4

where      is a constant 
(the Stefan-Boltzmann constant) which 

has a value of  
5.67 x 10 -8 W/m-2

(or 5.67 x 10 – 8 J / m2 )

and T is the absolute temperature
(in Kelvin)

Energy = T 4

p 35



Stefan-Boltzmann Law (easy way)

This law links:

the total amount of  energy flux
that is emitted by a blackbody
TO:  the body’s temperature

(actually, the 4th power of  the body’s 
absolute temperature)

“the hotter the body, the 
(much) greater the amount of  

energy flux or radiation”
p 35



The total amount of  energy flux described by 
the Stefan-Boltzmann Law 

is proportional to the area under the
Planck function curve

See p 40
in SGC-I



Stefan-Boltzmann Law:

“I’m COOL, so I 
“I’m HOT, so I emit emit  LESSER 
LARGE amounts amounts of  energy.
of  high intensity plus my ENERGY is 

energy” at a lower intensity  
than Mr. Hotshot 

over there!”





Why is this concept important?  

Because it means that:

the amount of  radiation
given off  by a body 

is a very sensitive function
of  its temperature

Therefore . . . small changes in temperature can lead 
to BIG changes in the amount of  radiation given off.

E =     T 4

p 35



Q2 – Which would you use:
the Planck Function or the Stefan-Boltzmann Law

to accurately compute 
the total amount of  ENERGY

emitted to space by planet Earth?

1. The Planck Function

2. The Stefan Boltzmann 
Law  Record your Q2 

answer now

3. Both of them together

4. Neither one is appropriate 
because the Earth is NOT 
a blackbody

Q3 – Which would you use:
the Planck Function or the Stefan-Boltzmann Law

to compute the total amount of energy
emitted to space by planet Earth, 

IF you assume the Earth emits like a blackbody 
& you know the Earth’s  temperature?

1. The Planck Function

2. The Stefan Boltzmann Law

3. Neither one is appropriate 
because you would need to 
know the wavelengths of

How to do it:

E =     T 4

E = Energy per unit area, so 
all we need to know is the 
AREA of  the emitting 
Earth’s surface + what T is.

you remember the 
formula for 
computing the area 
of  a sphere?

E = 4  R2 x T 4The area of  a sphere 
of  radius R is 

See box on p 42 in SGC 
for more details



LAW # 4:  Temperature and
wavelength

As substances get HOTTER, the 
wavelength at which radiation is 
emitted will become SHORTER. 

This is called Wien's law.

p 36



Wien’s Law can be represented as:

m = a/T
where λ m is the WAVELENGTH in the 
spectrum at which the energy peak occurs,   

(m indicates “max”)

T is the absolute TEMPERATURE
of  the body, and 

a is a constant (with a value of  2898)

(if    λ m is expressed in micrometers.)

p 36



Note the 
INVERSE 

relationship 
between 

wavelength 
and 

temperature

See p 40 in SGC-I



Wien’s Law (easy way)  

max = constant / T  
(Inverse relationship between 
wavelength and temperature)

“The hotter the body, the 
shorter the wavelength”

“The cooler the body, the 
longer the wavelength”

p 36



Wien’s Law -- Why is this concept 
important?  

Because it means that very HOT 
objects (like the sun) that radiate like 
blackbodies will radiate the maximum 
amount of  energy at SHORT 
wavelengths, 

while COOLER bodies will radiate most 
of  their energy at LONGER 
wavelengths.

p 36



Wein’s Law:
“I’m COOL, so I 

emit  my 
“I’m HOT, so I emit 

maximum amount 
my maximum 

of  radiation at 
amount of  

LONGER 
radiation at 

wavelengths”
SHORTER 

wavelengths”

SW = visible & ultraviolet (UV) LW = infrared (IR)




Wein’s is

Re-cap of  Laws # 2 - 4





Planck Function:
“I radiate at the 

E = h c / λ speed of  light like 
a blackbody;  most 

The Sun can emit of  my energy is 
emitted at shorter  

energy at ALL wavelengths “ 
wavelengths, but the 
amount of  energy 
emitted is inversely 
related to its 
wavelength.





Stefan-Boltzmann Law: E =     T 4

“I’m COOL, so I emit  
“I’m HOT, so I emit 

LESSER amounts of  
LARGE amounts 

energy;
of  high intensity 

plus my ENERGY is

at a lower intensity  
than Mr. Hotshot 

over there!”





Wein’s Law:
m = a / T

“I’m COOL, so I 

“I’m HOT, so I emit emit  my 

my maximum maximum amount 

amount of  of  radiation at 

radiation at LONGER 

SHORTER wavelengths”

wavelengths”

SW = visible & ultraviolet (UV) LW = infrared (IR)




Q4 – Which choice correctly 
matches the Stefan-Boltzmann 
LAW with its “mantra” (A, B, C):

 Record your Q4 
answer now



(A )  Wein’s Law: m = a / T

“The hotter the body, the shorter the wavelength”
The cooler the body, the longer the wavelength”

(B )  Planck Function: E = h c / λ

“SHORTER wavelengths have HIGHER intensity 
radiation than LONGER wavelengths” 

(C )  Stefan-Boltzmann Law: E =     T 4

“The hotter the body, the (much) greater the 
amount of  energy flux or radiation”

LAW #5:   Radiation & distance
-- the inverse-square law

The inverse square law 
describes: 

how solar FLUX of  ENERGY
decreases 

with increasing DISTANCE
from the source of  

the flux (i.e., the radiation), 
the Sun.

p 36



INVERSE SQUARE LAW =  

The amount of  radiation passing 
through a particular unit area is:

INVERSELY PROPORTIONAL
to the 

SQUARE of  the distance
of  that unit area from the source 

(1/d2)
p 36



The area intercepting the flux from the 
source at DISTANCE d is just one-fourth . . . 

. . . of  the area 
intercepting the same 
flux at  DISTANCE 2d

The ENERGY FLUX passing 
through AREA B 
is spread over an area four 
times (22) as large as AREA A

p 36



Inverse-Square Law (easy way):

If  we double the distance from the source 
to the interception point, the intensity of  

the radiation decreases by a factor of  
(1/2)2 = 1/4

If  we triple the distance from the source 
to the interception point, the intensity 

decreases by a factor of  
(1/3) 2 = 1/9





OR if  we reduce the distance 
from the source to the 

interception point by a factor 
of  2 or 3, the intensity of  the 

radiation increases by a 
factor of  

22 = 4 
or 

32 = 9





Why is this concept important?

Because it means that relatively 
SMALL changes in distance from 

the source of  energy 
(e.g., the Sun) 

can result in LARGE changes in the 
amount of  energy received 

by a planet’s surface.

LAW #6:  Selective emission 
and absorption

Some substances emit and 
absorb radiation at certain 
wavelengths only.  

This is mainly true of  gases.  

Why? 

p 37



Recall concept of  electron energy 
states (shells) allowing absorption 
of  photons/wavelengths of  only a 
specified frequency,

. . . and concept of  certain gas molecules
allowing absorption of  photons/wavelengths 
of  only specified frequencies because of  
how the gas molecules vibrate, bend, and 
rotate

review



NOT a 
GREENHOUSE 

GAS 
N2

GREENHOUSE 
GASES

H20 & CO2



When the H2O molecule emits a 
photon, its rotation rate decreases;

When it absorbs a photon, the 
rotation rate increases.



 Molecules can also absorb and 
emit IR radiation by changing the 
amplitude with which they 
vibrate.

If  the frequency at which a molecule 
vibrates matches the frequency of  
electromagnetic wave, the molecule 
can absorb a photon and begin to 
vibrate more vigorously.  



As a triatomic 
molecule, one way 
that CO2 vibrates is in 
a “bending mode” 
that has a frequency 
that allows CO2 to 
absorb IR radiation at 
a wavelength of  
about 15 micrometers

What about another triatomic   
molecule:  N2O  (Nitrous oxide)?



Mini-
ZOMBIE 
BREAK !



DANCE YOUR PhD !!

N2O acts as a greenhouse 
gas through the absorption 
of  radiation in 3 vibrational 

N O modes. 

N With one hand as a nitrogen 
atom, torso as central 
nitrogen, and the other hand 
as an oxygen atom, the 
dancers exhibit the three 
specific movements of  
N2O's vibrational modes. 

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5j6BS3XoLc




The N2O starts in the soil where it is 


produced by microbial activity and 
“moves on up” into the atmosphere.

Stepping onto the chairs represents the 
progression of  N2O to higher levels in 
the atmosphere (the stratosphere) 
where it is subject to intense Ultraviolet 
(UV) radiation from the sun. 

This high energy from the bombarding 
UV radiation is shown in the dancers' 
high energy, more spastic dancing. 

The high intensity UV radiation leads 
to the destruction of  N2O  -- seen as 
jumping from the chair at the end 



We will learn later that interaction of   N2O in the 
stratosphere with UV wavelengths is related to 

OZONE DEPLETION  

. . . but N2O also vibrates & bends when 
absorbing Infrared (IR) wavelengths

. . .  It is the ability to absorb
and emit IR radiation that 

makes N2O a GREENHOUSE 
GAS! 



Recap:    LAW # 6 states that 

Substances absorb only 
radiation of  wavelengths they 
can emit.

The frequency & wavelength of  
a photon absorbed by a given 
electron, atom, molecule will be 
the same as the frequency / 
wavelength with which it is 
emitted.

p 37



DEFINITION OF GREENHOUSE GASES

(def): Greenhouse gases are gases 
which both absorb and emit 
electromagnetic radiation in the 
infrared (IR) part of  the spectrum.

Once IR is absorbed by the greenhouse 
gases in the atmosphere, it can be emitted 
back to the Earth’s surface to heat it all 
over again!  

Or it can be emitted upward to outer space 
and be lost from the system altogether.

p 37



Modified cartoon IR radiation is 
representation, showing emitted from 

possible IR pathways: the Earth’s 
surface right 
out to space 
through 

IR radiation “IR window”
is absorbed 
by GH gases 
in the 
atmosphere IR radiation 
and emitted is absorbed 
out to space by GH gases 

in the 
atmosphere 
and emitted 

Earth absorbs  SW back to Earth



The absorbtion of  LW (IR) radiation 
and the re-radiation of  LW (IR)  
energy to the Earth’s surface by GH 
gases is what keeps the Earth in the 
"just right" temperature range for 
water to be present in all 3 phases 
and just right  for US too!

Without the "Greenhouse Effect," 
the Earth would be too COLD for life 
as we know it!
