INTRODUCTION + AIMS 

You will use the observational and analysis tools of modern astronomy, mimicking the setup that 
professional astronomers see when they use a large telescope, via VIREO - the Virtual Educational 
Observatory. 

You will produce and compare Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams of star clusters. You will use the 
telescope to calculate the magnitudes and colours of individual stars in the clusters. You will fit a 
zero-age main sequence to estimate the distance to the cluster, and an isochrone to estimate the 
age of the cluster. You will compare your estimations to other clusters and to the literature values. 

If you come across a word or phrase that you do not understand, consult the glossary at the end of 
this manual. Throughout the manual, the words and phrases included in the glossary are in bold. 

You will find questions throughout the workshop. To answer the questions, use your own knowledge, 
the glossary, or conduct independent research in the scientific literature (online or in a textbook). 

 

Installing the Software 

IMPORTANT - the VIREO software is only available on Windows operating systems. 
 
Go to: http://www3.gettysburg.edu/~marschal/clea/CLEAhome.html  
On the left-hand menu, select Software, then scroll down and select HR Diagrams of 
Clusters. On the right-hand side, click VIREO.zip, and save it in the desired location. 
Warning: the program may take up to an hour to download, depending on the speed of the 
connection. The software should be installed on each computer to be used for the workshop, prior 
to the workshop. Alternatively, it is possible to install the software onto a server/network for access 
by individual workstations. For more information, visit the CLEA webpage above. 

Students will also require access to the internet to research the star clusters, however the necessary 
information could be alternatively provided. See the Help Sheet for more details.

THEORY 

The Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram 

A Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (HRD) is one of the most useful tools that astronomers use to study 
the evolution of stars. Typically, HRDs are plotted as the temperature of the star against its 
luminosity.

An alternative way to present the same information is via a colour-magnitude diagram (CMD). Here, 
the colour index of a star (typically B-V) is plotted against its absolute magnitude (typically in the V 
filter). The brighter a star is, the more negative its magnitude. For example, a star with M=-2.5 is 
brighter than a star with M=+2.5. 

In the diagram, the hottest, brightest stars lie in the upper left, and the coolest, dimmest stars lie in 
the lower right. Stars in the upper right of the diagram are extremely bright despite having low 
surface temperatures. This requires the stars to have large surface areas; these are the red giants 
and supergiants, with radii many times that of the Sun. Stars in the lower left of the diagram are 
extremely faint despite their high temperatures; these stars are small, with radii much smaller than 
that of the Sun, and are known as white dwarfs. 

The most common stars are those on the main sequence, the region where stars spend the majority 
of their lives. Main sequence stars burn hydrogen into helium, via nuclear fusion, in their cores. The 
position of a star on the main sequence depends on its mass. The lower mass stars (from the mass of 
the Sun down to about 0.08 solar masses) are cooler and dimmer, and occupy the lower right of the 
main sequence. The higher mass stars (from about 2 to 50 solar masses) are hotter and brighter, and 
occupy the upper left of the main sequence.

Star Clusters 

Star clusters are simply groups of stars. There are 2 types of star clusters: open clusters and globular 
clusters. Globular clusters are tight groups of ancient stars, and are poorly understood. Open 
clusters, however, are an incredibly useful tool for astronomers. It is believed that all of the stars in 
an open cluster formed from the same collapsing cloud of interstellar gas, and are roughly the same 
age. Open clusters tend to be much smaller and younger than globular clusters. The stars within a 
cluster have a range of stellar masses, and so when the cluster is young (and its stars have just begun 
to fuse hydrogen into helium in their cores), the stars will all lie along the main sequence. This forms 
the zero-age main sequence (ZAMS). 

 

Distance to Star Clusters 

It is possible to use HRDs (or CMDs) to determine the distance to a star cluster. All of the stars in a 
cluster are roughly the same distance from us, and their light is dimmed according to that distance. 
A diagram of the apparent magnitudes of the stars against their colour indices is plotted for the star 
cluster, forming an observational CMD. Typically, the apparent magnitude used is that through the 
yellow filter, which is written as V. The colour index used is then B-V.  

The resulting main sequence is compared to the ZAMS (which is plotted using absolute magnitudes 
M, instead of apparent magnitudes m), and the difference between the apparent and absolute 
magnitudes can be calculated: this is the distance modulus, m-M. In the V filter, the distance 
modulus is written as V-Mv. The distance D to a cluster (in parsecs) can be calculated using the 
formula: 

௠ିெ
logଵ଴𝐷 = + 1.

Aging of Star Clusters 

As a star ages, it begins to run out of hydrogen fuel in its core. Hydrogen then begins to burn in a 
shell around the core, and the star expands and cools, becoming a red giant. The first stars to 
become red giants are the most massive stars in the cluster, followed by the less massive stars. 
Therefore, as a cluster ages, the main sequence gets shorter and the red giant region becomes 
increasingly populated (as shown in the diagrams below). The main sequence turnoff point is 
indicated in the diagrams by a grey circle. 

Astronomers use the length of the main sequence to estimate the age of a cluster. By comparing the 
HRD observed to a computer model called an isochrone, it is possible to precisely determine the age 
of a star cluster. 

  

100 million years (0.1 GYr) 800 million years (0.8 GYr) 

  

5 billion years (5 GYr) 10 billion years (10 GYr)

METHOD 

Setting up the Telescope 

 Double click VIREO to open the program. 
 Click File  login, and type your name as Student #1, then ok and yes. 
 Click File  Run exercise  HR Diagrams of Star Clusters. 
 Now, you need to access a telescope to observe the star clusters. 

Click Telescopes  Optical  Access 0.4 Meter. 
 You should see the inside of the telescope dome. Click the switch to open the dome. 

What is the wavelength range of an optical telescope? 

____________________________________ 

 

Locating the Star Cluster 

 Select the first star cluster to observe, The Pleiades: 
Click File  Cluster Data  File  View/Select Cluster from List. 
Double click on M45 (Pleiades), then click ok. 
A list of 297 stars in the star cluster should appear, alongside their positions in the sky. 

 Click Selection  Create New Hot List of Entire List  ok. 
Now, close this list of stars. 

 Turn the Telescope Control Panel on. 
 The field-of-view of the telescope changes with the rotation of the Earth. This will make 

observing the star clusters very difficult, and so the telescope needs to account for the Earth’s 
rotation to track the stars in the sky. Turn on tracking, so that the light turns green. You 
should notice that the field-of-view of the telescope now stays fixed. 

Observing the sky from the Northern hemisphere, which star remains fixed in the sky whilst the 
other stars rotate around it? In which direction do they rotate? 

_________________________________________________________________________ 

 Now we need to slew (move) the telescope to the target location in the sky. 
Click Slew  Observation Hot List  View/Select from List. 
This will open a list of the stars in the Pleiades cluster. Double click on the first star in the list 
(named N2230-00614). Click ok then yes. 

 The telescope has now located that particular star in the cluster. Switch the view from Finder 
to Telescope. You should now see a bright star in the centre of the field-of-view, inside a red 
circle. This red circle indicates the region inside which the photometer collects light.

Observing the Star Cluster - Sky Background Observation 

 Access the photometer. The Photometer Control window will open; you will use this to make 
observations of the individual stars in the cluster. 

 Before making an observation of an astronomical object, a ‘sky background’ observation must 
be made. This is because the photometer measures all of the light it can see, which includes 
light from the star and light from the sky background. The program subtracts the light from the 
background, leaving only the light from the star - which is important for the analysis. 
Switch the reading to sky. 

 Using the Telescope Control Panel, slew the field-of-view away from the central star. Move the 
telescope slightly N, E, S or W, so that the red circle contains a dark patch of sky. This should be 
roughly 2 red circle-diameters away from the central star, in any direction. 

 In this observing session, we will use the B and the V filters. Switch to the Photometer Control 
window. Firstly, make a ‘sky background’ observation using the V filter: ensure that Filter is 
set to V. As a standard, we set the integration time to be 10.0 seconds, and we complete 3 
integrations. You may need to adjust the sliders to these values. 

 Click Start the integration. You must not move the telescope during the integration, and the 
integration must be complete before starting the next observation. 

 There is a timer to display the duration of the observation, and a counter of the completed 
integrations. The red counter at the bottom is a running total of the number of photon counts. 
The number of photon counts in each integration is displayed as Raw Counts. The program 
also calculates the mean number of counts per second in each integration. 

 Keeping the Reading set to Sky, repeat the process for the same dark patch, this time using 
the B filter. Again, the observation should be 3 integrations each of 10.0s duration. 
 

Observing the Star Cluster - Stellar Observation 

 Using the telescope Control Panel, slew the telescope back onto the star, so that it lies in the 
centre of the red circle. 

 Switch Filter to V, and Reading to Object. 
 Now, we need to set the duration of the observation. Try 4 integrations, each 1.0s long. The aim 

is to achieve a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N Ratio) in the range 100 - 200 for the observation to 
be successful. In this case, the S/N Ratio is approximately 105, which indicates a successful 
observation of the star. 

 If the S/N ratio is too low, the noise in the observation is too high compared to the signal from 
the star; this will make the analysis inaccurate. For particularly dim stars, a S/N ratio of 70 or 
above is acceptable. 

 You may need to adjust the integration parameters (Integration Seconds and # of 
Integrations) until a successful observation has been made. A longer integration allows 
more light into the telescope, and increases the number of photon counts. If you need to retake 
an observation, simply change the integration parameters, Start the integration, click no 
when asked to save/record the data, and then ok. 

 Once a successful observation has been made, click File  Data  Record/Review, 
then ok and ok. The program has calculated the apparent magnitude of the star in the V filter 
from your observations.

Think: what is the difference between the apparent magnitude 
and the absolute magnitude of a star? 

 The observation of the star needs repeating in the B filter. Switch Filter to B. Try an 
observation with the same integration parameters as your successful V filter observation. Look 
at the S/N ratio to see if the integration needs adjusting. Once a successful B filter observation 
has been completed, click File  Data  Record/Review, then ok and ok. The 
program has now calculated the apparent magnitude of the star in the B filter from your 
observations. 

 

Plotting the Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram 

 In the main VIREO window, click Tools  Results Editors  Observational 
Results  Display/Print/Save Text. The results from your observation will be 
shown. There are columns displaying the V filter and B filter magnitudes, alongside other 
information about the star. 

 The program uses the observational data to plot a HRD, or in this case a colour-magnitude 
diagram (CMD). The colour index B-V is plotted on the x-axis, and the apparent magnitude in 
the V filter is plotted on the y-axis. Look at the observational data you have taken, and predict 
the (B-V, V) coordinate of the star on the CMD: 

Star N2230-00614 
V  
B  

B-V  
(B-V, V)  

 

 Close the Recorded Results window, and click Tools  HR Diagram Analysis. 
 A CMD will appear on the screen. A single star will be plotted - this is the star from your 

observations! Confirm that it appears in the location that you predicted, by looking at the B-V 
and V values. 

 Now, it is time to populate your CMD with observations of more stars in the cluster. Return to 
the Telescope Control Panel. Click Slew  Observation Hot List  View/Select 
from List to open the list of cluster stars. 

 Double click on another star in the list - choose any star. Click ok then yes. 
 Repeat the steps outlined in Observing the Star Cluster - Stellar Observation. There is no need to 

repeat the sky background observations, since the stars in the cluster are relatively close 
together in the sky. You should obtain values of the apparent magnitude in the V and B filter for 
your chosen star. 

 To access these values, click Tools  Results Editors  Observational 
Results  Display/Print/Save Text. Record your results in the table below:

 In the CMD window, click File  Load/Plot  Data from Observations. A 
second point should appear on the CMD, at the (B-V, V) coordinate of the second star observed 
in the cluster. 

 Repeat the process for 3 more stars in the cluster (or until further instructions from your 
teacher/supervisor). Each time, add them to the CMD as above. You should see the main 
sequence beginning to emerge in the diagram. 

 It would take many hours to manually observe and plot each star in the cluster. In the CMD 
window, click File  Load/Plot  Select Cluster Data, and double click on 
M45 (Pleiades). The completed CMD should appear, containing 297 stars. 

 

Part 1 - Distance to the Star Cluster 

 Click Tools  Zero-Age Main Sequence to plot the ZAMS on the cluster CMD. 
 On the right of the CMD window, there is a slide-bar to control the distance modulus, V-Mv. 

Increase the distance modulus until the ZAMS matches well to the middle of the main sequence 
on the CMD. For the Pleiades, the distance modulus is between +5.00 and +6.00 - see if you can 
get a better fit to the data with a more accurate value. 

Distance modulus:    ____________ 

 Using the distance modulus equation given before, calculate the distance to the star cluster, in 
parsecs. Record your answer below, and in the table over the page. 

What is the distance to the Pleiades cluster? 

_______________ parsecs _______________ lightyears 

 Conduct some independent research in the literature (online or in a textbook) to find an 
accurate distance to the Pleiades cluster. Compare this value to the value you have calculated. 

Think: why might the distance to the cluster you have calculated differ from the literature value?

Part 2 - Age of the Star Cluster 

 Click Tools  Isochrones to plot an isochrone on the CMD. The isochrone parameter 
window should appear. 

 There are two slide-bars to adjust to obtain a good fit of the isochrone to the data. The upper 
slide-bar adjusts the age of the isochrone, and the lower slide-bar adjusts the B-V value of the 
isochrone. A key feature to match is the main sequence turnoff point, at the left end of the 
main sequence. These stars are the first in the cluster reach the end of their main sequence 
lifetimes. The red giant phase of evolution is much quicker than the main sequence, and so there 
will be relatively few red giant stars compared to main sequence stars. 

 The data for stars on the main sequence will be much more scattered than the sharp isochrone 
line. Some of this scatter is intrinsic to the cluster: for example, binary stars are brighter than 
individual stars at the same distance, which thickens the main sequence. More importantly, not 
all of the stars in the cluster are exactly the same distance from us. You will obtain a more 
accurate age by matching the isochrone to the lower edge of the main sequence, to avoid some 
of these outliers. 

 You can also adjust the metallicity of the stars in the cluster. By default, this parameter is set to 
the solar values. Different values of the metallicity may improve the fit of the isochrone, but it is 
usually easier to maintain the solar values and focus on adjusting the age of the cluster. 

 Once the best fit has been found, read off the age of the cluster, given in GYr (109 years). Record 
your answer below, and in the table further down the page. 

Age of the Pleiades cluster:    ____________________ 

 Conduct some independent research in the literature (online or in a textbook) to find an 
estimate for the age of the Pleiades cluster. Compare this value to the value you have calculated. 

Think: why might there be an uncertainty in the age of the cluster determined by this method? 

Think: how does the age you have calculated compare to the age of the universe? 

 

Part 3 - Comparison of Star Clusters 

 Once you are satisfied with the fit of the ZAMS and the isochrone, print a copy of your CMD for 
the Pleiades star cluster (File  Print). 

 Click Tools  View/Print Parameters. Record the parameters you have selected in 
the table below:

 Now, we will compare this CMD to that of a different star cluster, the Hyades. In the CMD 

window, click File  Load/Plot  Select Cluster Data, then double click on 
Hyades. 

Consider the shape of the CMD for the Hyades. 
Do you expect the Hyades to be older or younger than the Pleiades, and why? 

____________________________________________________________________________

 Repeat the steps outlined in Part 1 - Distance to the Star Cluster to fit the ZAMS. Then, repeat 
the steps outlined in Part 2 - Age of the Star Cluster to fit the isochrone. 

 Once you are satisfied with the fit of the ZAMS and the isochrone, print a copy of your CMD for 
the Hyades star cluster (File  Print). 

 Click Tools  View/Print Parameters. Record the parameters you have selected in 
the table below: 

The Hyades 
V-MV

 We will consider a final comparison. Click File  Load/Plot  Select Cluster 
Data, then double click on M67 (NGC 2682).  

Consider the shape of the CMD for M67. 
What can be inferred about the age of the star cluster, and why? 

____________________________________________________________________________ 

____________________________________________________________________________ 

____________________________________________________________________________ 

 Repeat the steps outlined in Part 1 - Distance to the Star Cluster to fit the ZAMS. Then, repeat 
the steps outlined in Part 2 - Age of the Star Cluster to fit the isochrone. 

 Once you are satisfied with the fit of the ZAMS and the isochrone, print a copy of your CMD for 
the M67 star cluster (File  Print). 

 Click Tools  View/Print Parameters. Record the parameters you have selected in 
the table over the page:

 Consider the similarities and differences between the CMDs for the Pleiades, the Hyades, and 
M67. Compare these similarities and differences to those in the parameters you have chosen for 
each cluster. 

 Consider the CMD for the Hyades: there should be a population of stars in the lower left of the 
diagram. These stars do not belong to the main sequence, instead they are known as: 
                        ______________________________. 

Think: what does this population of stars suggest about the age of the cluster? 

Think: why is this population of stars not found in the Pleiades cluster?

EXTENSION + CONCLUSION 

 If you have finished comparing the Pleiades, the Hyades, and M67, and have answered all of the 
questions throughout this manual, look at this extension task. Following the same method as 
before, analyse the CMDs of a further three star clusters. Record your results in the table below: 

 V-M Distance to Estimated B-V 
V cluster cluster age adjustment 

Mel 20     
Alpha-Persei 

M44     
(NGC 2632) 

M7     
(NGC 6475) 

 

Think: could you predict the relative ages of the clusters before fitting the isochrones? 

 Finally, open the CMD of M16 (NGC 6611). Try to fit a ZAMS to the data. You will find it difficult 
to know where the ZAMS should sit on the diagram. M16 is a very young star cluster - only about 
2 million years old! None of its stars are old enough to have evolved off the main sequence, and 
become red giants. 

 The distance to the star cluster is 2150 pc. Use this information to calculate the distance 
modulus, and use the slide-bar to place the ZAMS in its correct location on the diagram. Would 
you have chosen this fit? M16 shows the limits of estimating the distances to star clusters using 
this method. 

 Now, plot an isochrone. You will find it difficult to match the data - indeed, the cluster is so 
young that the software cannot fit an isochrone. The cluster is too young to have a main 
sequence turnoff point, and so M16 shows the limits of estimating the ages of star clusters using 
this method. 

Think: how does the age of M16 compare to the age of our Sun, or the Earth? 

 Conduct some independent research into the M16 star cluster, also known as the Eagle Nebula. 
Search for images of the cluster taken by the Hubble Space Telescope; you may recognise the 
incredible ‘pillars of creation’ photographs. 

In this workshop, you have acted as a professional astronomer to calculate the distance to, and age 
of, several star clusters. You have interacted with a telescope as an astronomer would. You have 
taken data and analysed your data using software, as an astronomer would. You have conducted 
independent research to verify your results, as an astronomer would. 

The VIREO software can be used in many different ways - take a look at the website to discover the 
other astronomy resources available: http://www3.gettysburg.edu/~marschal/clea/CLEAhome.html

GLOSSARY (A-Z) 

Absolute magnitude (M or MV): 

The apparent magnitude an object would have if it was 10 parsecs away from Earth. 

Apparent magnitude (m or V): 

An object’s magnitude as seen by the telescope on Earth. 

Binary star: 

A system of two stars orbiting each other. At great distances from a binary star system, it is 
impossible to see the individual stars, and instead they look like a single bright star. 

Celestial coordinates, right ascension (RA) + declination (dec): 

This is the coordinate system used by astronomers. Right ascension is equivalent to longitude, 
and declination is equivalent to latitude. 

Colour index (B-V): 

A way of representing the temperature of a star. B-V is the magnitude through the B filter, minus 
the magnitude through the V filter. 

Colour-magnitude diagram (CMD): 

The same as a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, but its axes are colour (B-V) against magnitude V. 

Distance modulus: 

The difference between the apparent magnitude and the absolute magnitude of an object, m-M. 

Filter: 

A device placed in front of a telescope, only allowing certain wavelengths of light to pass 
through and be recorded. The V filter allows wavelengths in the range 450-650nm, which is 
yellow light. The B filter allows wavelengths in the range 360-520nm, which is blue light. 

Globular cluster: 

A tightly bound group of stars. Much older than open clusters. 

Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (HRD): 

A plot of luminosities against effective temperatures of stars. 

Integration time: 

The length of time that the CCD camera is switched on and collecting photons. 

Isochrone: 

A curve on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, representing stars of the same age.

Magnitude: 

A measure of the brightness of an object. The brighter the object, the more negative its 
magnitude. 

Main sequence: 

A highly-populated band of stars on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. The majority of stars are 
on the main sequence, burning hydrogen into helium in their cores. 

Main sequence turnoff point: 

The point on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram at which stars leave the main sequence and enter 
the red giant phase of evolution. The turnoff point is directly related to the age of the cluster. 

Metallicity: 

The fraction of the mass of the star in elements heavier than hydrogen and helium (known as 
metals). 

Open cluster: 

A group of stars which formed from the same molecular cloud at roughly the same time. 

Parsec (pc): 

Unit of length used to measure distances outside the solar system. Equal to 3.1x1016m. 

Photometer: 

An instrument which measures the intensity of light, by collecting and counting photons. 

Photon: 

An individual packet of electromagnetic light. 

Signal-to-noise ratio (S/N ratio): 

Ratio of the number of photons from the source compared to the number of photons from 
unwanted interference, such as the sky background and the electronics. 

Sky background: 

An observation of a region of the sky containing no astronomical objects. Since an observation of 
an object will also include a contribution of light from the background, this must be subtracted 
to calibrate the observation.  

Zero age main sequence (ZAMS): 

The position of a star when it first enters the main sequence.
