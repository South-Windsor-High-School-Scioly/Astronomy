ABSTRACT

Context. This work presents the characterization of 27 young early-type stars, most of them in the age range 1–10 Myr, and three
suspected hot companions of post-T Tauri stars belonging to the Lindroos binary sample. Most of these objects show IR excesses in
their spectral energy distributions, which are indicative of the presence of disks. The work is relevant in the fields of stellar physics,
physics of disks and formation of planetary systems.
Aims. The aim of the work is the determination of the effective temperature, gravity, metallicity, mass, luminosity and age of these
stars. An accurate modelling of their disks requires the knowledge of most of these parameters, since they will determine the energy
input received by the disk and hence, its geometry and global properties.
Methods. Spectral energy distributions and mid-resolution spectra were used to estimate Teff , the effective temperature. The com-
parison of the profiles of the Balmer lines with synthetic profiles provides the value of the stellar gravity, g∗. High-resolution optical
observations and synthetic spectra are used to estimate the metallicity, [M/H]. Once Teff , g∗ and [M/H] are known for each star,
evolutionary tracks and isochrones provide estimations of the mass, luminosity, age and distances (or upper limits in some cases).
The method is original in the sense that it is distance-independent, i.e. the estimation of the stellar parameters does not require the
knowledge of the distance to the object.
Results. Stellar parameters (effective temperature, gravity, metallicity, mass, luminosity, age and distances – or upper limits) are
obtained for the sample of stars mentioned above. A detailed discussion of some individual objects, in particular VV Ser, RR Tau,
49 Cet and the three suspected hot companions of post-T Tauris, is presented.
Conclusions. These results, apart from their intrinsic interest, would be extremely valuable to model the disks surrounding the stars.
The paper also shows the difficulty posed by the morphology and behaviour of the system star+disk in the computation of the stellar
parameters.

dark and dome flat-field frames were taken each night. Standard
procedures were used to process the data. The nominal posi-
tions of the Balmer lines were used to self-calibrate the spectra
in wavelength; a second-order polynomial wavelength-pixel was
used. The widths of the lines of the calibration Hg-He-Rb lamps
were used to obtain the width of the instrumental profile of the
spectrograph for each night.

High-resolution echelle spectra were used in the computa-
tion of the metallicities (Sect. 4.3). These spectra were taken
during the four EXPORT campaigns in 1998 and 1999 with
the Utrech Echelle Spectrograph (UES) on the 4.2-m William
Herschel Telescope (WHT) at the Observatorio del Roque de
los Muchachos (La Palma, Spain). UES was set up to provide
a wavelength coverage between 3800 and 5900 Å. The spectra
were dispersed into 59 echelle orders with a resolving power of
48 000. The slit width was set to 1.15 arcsec projected on the
sky. Details of the observing runs and the reduction of the UES
observations can be found in Mora et al. (2001).

4. The computation of the stellar parameters
Figure 1 shows a sketch of the whole procedure we follow to
compute the stellar parameters. In the next paragraphs of this
Section we describe in detail every step.

4.1. The effective temperature

The effective temperature is the first quantity needed to start the
computation of the whole set of parameters. The procedure to
estimate Teff followed in this work and also by Merín (2004)
consists of a comparison of the observed spectral energy dis-
tribution, more precisely of its photospheric part (see Sect. 6.1
for a discussion on this), with a grid of low-resolution syn-
thetic spectra (Kurucz 1993), with different effective tempera-
tures1 and reddened with a range of extinctions, typically from
E(B − V) = 0.1 to 1.2, in those cases when no solution with the
original models was found. The total-to-selective extinction RV
used is 3.1 although some studies (e.g. Hernández et al. 2004)
suggest that a higher value (RV ∼ 5) could be more appropriate
to model the extinction caused by the environment of HAeBe
stars. We will discuss this choice in Sect. 6.4. The synthetic spec-
tra were normalized to the observed SED and the best fits were
chosen after a careful comparison and assessment of each case.

In some cases a degeneracy appeared, i.e. two or more syn-
thetic spectra fit the observed SED reasonably well, therefore ad-
ditional information (e.g. the best fit between the observed and
synthetic Balmer profiles) had to be used to break it and choose
the correct solution. In Sect. 6.4 we show how to solve this and
other problems found at this first step for some of the objects,
in particular the very complex cases of VV Ser and RR Tau.
The degeneracy cannot be broken using the intrinsic photomet- Fig. 1. A flow chart sketching the procedure we use to estimate the stel-

stars: two synthetic spectra corresponding to two different sets
of values (Teff, g∗) can fit the observed photometric points for
two different values of E(B−V), both of them being consistent
with the intrinsic colours of stars of each spectral type reddened

The SEDs are built from simultaneous optical and near- results. Among our data, the photometry corresponding to the

place the star in an HR diagram log g∗ − log Teff and superim-
pose the appropriate set of evolutionary tracks and isochrones
for that specific metallicity. This gives directly – or after a sim-
ple interpolation between the tracks and isochrones enclosing
the position of the star – the stellar mass and the age. In addi-
tion, since there is a one-to-one correspondence between a pair
(Teff, g∗) on a given track and a pair (Teff, L∗/L), one can also
estimate the stellar luminosity in solar units, and if the observed
– dereddened – stellar flux, F∗, is known through the SED, then,
an estimation of the distance can also be made. The values of
F∗ are taken from Merín (2004) or determinations carried out
in this work. F∗ is computed by fully integrating the flux of the
dereddened synthetic Kurucz model that is considered to best fit
the photospheric part of the SED.

The evolutionary tracks for a scaled solar mixture from the
Yonsei-Yale group (Yi et al. 2001) – Y2 in their notation – have
been used in this work. The Y2 set contains tracks up to M =
5.2 M, therefore, the tracks from Siess et al. (2000) for masses
above that value were used in a few cases (see Sect. 5.2, for
details).

5. Results
5.1. Gravities and metallicities

Table 2 shows the values of the effective temperature, gravity and
metallicity (the latter when high-resolution observations were
available) for the stars in the sample. In three cases, namely
HR 26 A, HR 9043 and λ Boo, specified in the table, values
of Teff obtained by other authors with a methodology different
from that of Merín (2004) or this work have been used; for the
first two stars the calibrations used in those papers gave more
accurate results than ours, whereas for λ Boo the value adopted
is a mean of the effective temperatures from two works where
detailed studies of this star are made. The fourth column of the
lower part of the table gives a generic value of [M/H], estimated
by comparing the observed spectra with the synthetic ones and
trying to mach the shape and depth of the non-variable blends
composed of many broadened individual lines. The determina-
tions of [M/H] for HR 10, XY Per and VV Ser are marked with
a colon, indicating that they are very uncertain given the large
amount of circumstellar lines contaminating the photospheric

They provide results for [Fe/H]. Apart from the extreme Fe abun-
dance of HD 100546 (not studied in this work), namely −1.4,
in agreement with the value −1.30 given by Acke & Waelkens
(2004), the abundances for their sample vary from −1.0 to +0.5.

The three samples are not large enough to draw any defini-
tive statistical conclusion, although it is apparent that both in
our work and in Acke & Waelkens’ (2004) the majority of the
stars tend to lie around metallicities close to the solar one. The
highest metallicities found in any of the three works are around
+0.80 whereas the lowest ones are below −1.0.
