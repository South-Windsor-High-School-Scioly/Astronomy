ABSTRACT

Context. This work presents the characterization of 27 young early-type stars, most of them in the age range 1–10 Myr, and three
suspected hot companions of post-T Tauri stars belonging to the Lindroos binary sample. Most of these objects show IR excesses in
their spectral energy distributions, which are indicative of the presence of disks. The work is relevant in the fields of stellar physics,
physics of disks and formation of planetary systems.
Aims. The aim of the work is the determination of the eﬀective temperature, gravity, metallicity, mass, luminosity and age of these
stars. An accurate modelling of their disks requires the knowledge of most of these parameters, since they will determine the energy
input received by the disk and hence, its geometry and global properties.
Methods. Spectral energy distributions and mid-resolution spectra were used to estimate T eﬀ , the eﬀective temperature. The comparison of the profiles of the Balmer lines with synthetic profiles provides the value of the stellar gravity, g∗ . High-resolution optical
observations and synthetic spectra are used to estimate the metallicity, [M/H]. Once T eﬀ , g∗ and [M/H] are known for each star,
evolutionary tracks and isochrones provide estimations of the mass, luminosity, age and distances (or upper limits in some cases).
The method is original in the sense that it is distance-independent, i.e. the estimation of the stellar parameters does not require the
knowledge of the distance to the object.
Results. Stellar parameters (eﬀective temperature, gravity, metallicity, mass, luminosity, age and distances – or upper limits) are
obtained for the sample of stars mentioned above. A detailed discussion of some individual objects, in particular VV Ser, RR Tau,
49 Cet and the three suspected hot companions of post-T Tauris, is presented.
Conclusions. These results, apart from their intrinsic interest, would be extremely valuable to model the disks surrounding the stars.
The paper also shows the diﬃculty posed by the morphology and behaviour of the system star+disk in the computation of the stellar
parameters.

1. Introduction
One of the most active research areas in PMS (pre-main sequence) stellar physics is the study of stars with protoplanetary
disks. Today it is widely accepted that circumstellar disks are
a common feature of the star formation processes (Beckwith
1996). The percentage of accretion disks around young stars
ranges from 50 to 100%, at least for the youngest star-forming
regions (Kenyon & Hartmann 1995; Hillenbrand et al. 1998).
A study in the near infrared of young clusters by Haisch et al.
(2001) in the age range 0.3–30 Myr shows that at early ages, the
cluster disk fraction is around 80%, and decreases as the cluster
age increases, the typical overall disk lifetime being 5–7 Myr.
The work by those authors, confirmed by Hillenbrand (2005),
Cieza (2008) and Hernández et al. (2008) was based on samples
containing mostly T Tauri stars (spectral types K and M). In the

Astronomical Centre, Calar Alto, jointly operated by the MaxPlanck Institut für Astronomie and the Instituto de Astrofísica de
Andalucía (CSIC), and on observations made with the WHT telescope

Astrofísica de Canarias.

mass range of the Herbig Ae/Be stars (spectral types B to F),
Hernández et al. (2005) found that the lifetime of primordial
disks is less than ∼3 Myr. There is evidence that the typical times
for disk dissipation depend on stellar mass (e.g. Sicilia-Aguilar
et al. 2005), although in all cases this phenomenon seems to occur in the first few million years of the stellar lifetime.
The formation of planets and planetary systems takes place
in circumstellar disks. The report in 1995 of the discovery of the
first extrasolar planet around a solar-type star, namely 51 Peg, by
Mayor & Queloz (1995), and the subsequent detections of candidate planets increased even further the interest in that area, and
in particular, the study of the evolution of PMS stars and their
disks in a range of ages of the order of ∼106 years, when the
disks have their characteristic morphology and processes of potential formation of planetesimals have already been triggered.
The mass, radius and eﬀective temperature of the central star
will determine the energy received by the disk and therefore – at
least in part – its geometry, energy balance, accretion rate and
contribution to the spectral energy distribution (SED hereafter).
The metal abundance of the star, a parameter which is many
times overlooked and assumed to take the solar value, is also
an important factor because the gas contained in the disk will
have, to a first approximation, a similar metal content, which,

in turn, will have an influence on its evolution and the potential
formation of planets (see e.g. Wyatt et al. 2007, and references
therein). In addition, the gas dominates the mass and dynamics of the disk (e.g. Hillenbrand 2008). The knowledge of the
metallicity is also important to place the star in the appropriate
set of evolutionary tracks to determine parameters such as mass,
luminosity and age (Merín et al. 2004). Therefore, in this context, the determination of parameters and properties of stars –i.e.
what we call their “characterization”– in the critical age range of
1–10 Myr, is a necessary step to accurately model the disks.
Several works have aimed at a systematic determination of
parameters of PMS and young MS stars (T Tauri, Herbig Ae/Be,
Vega and A-shell) with disks. Dunkin et al. (1997a,b) carried out a complete study of 14 Vega-type objects based on
high-resolution spectroscopy. Kovalchuk & Pugach (1997) determined the gravity for a sample of 19 Herbig Ae/Be stars.
The spectral classification, projected rotational velocities and
variability of 80 PMS and young MS stars were studied by
Eiroa et al. (2001), Eiroa et al. (2002), Mora et al. (2001) and
Oudmaijer et al. (2001). Hernández et al. (2004) carried out an
analysis of 75 Herbig Ae/Be stars, deriving spectral types and
studying the properties of the extinction caused by the environment of these objects. Acke & Waelkens (2004) presented
an abundance study of 24 Herbig Ae/Be and Vega-type stars
searching for the λ Bootis phenomenon, and Guimarães et al.
(2006) determined stellar gravities and metal abundances for
12 Herbig Ae/Be stars. Manoj et al. (2006) studied the evolution
of the emission line activity for a sample of 45 Herbig Ae/Be
stars and estimated masses, luminosities and ages for an enlarged
sample of 91 objects of this type.
In this paper we present the results of the determination of
eﬀective temperatures, stellar gravities, metallicities, masses, luminosities, ages and distances for 30 young stars. In Sects. 2
and 3 we describe the sample of stars and the observations.
Section 4 describes how the stellar parameters were estimated.
Sections 5 and 6 present the results and a detailed discussion.
Finally, some comments are given in Sect. 7.

2. The sample of stars
In this work we study the properties of a sample of 30 earlytype objects, namely 19 Herbig Ae/Be (hereafter HAeBe), five
Vega-type, three A-shell and three suspected hot companions of
post-T Tauri stars (see Sect. 6.4 to see why we add the qualifier
“suspected” to these stars). In Table 1 we list some properties of
the stars. Column 1 gives the identification of the object, Col. 2
provides other identifications, when available, from the MWC,
BD or HD catalogues; Col. 3, the type of star; Col. 4, the projected rotational velocity v sin i and Col. 5 indicates whether the
star has emission in the Hα line or not. Since the presence or absence of this emission is an indicator of activity, these data will
be useful to discuss the evolutionary status of the objects. The
stars were chosen from the EXPORT sample (Eiroa et al. 2000).
Apart from the intrinsic interest of the objects, one of the peculiarities of analysing these kinds of early-type objects is that
the determination of gravities, as we will see in Sect. 4.2, is feasible due to the fact that, for stars with T eﬀ above approximately
7500 K, the shapes of the profiles of the Balmer lines have a
strong dependence on stellar gravity. Provided that an estimation
of T eﬀ is available, log g∗ can be derived and a determination of
other stellar parameters performed.
The stars HR 26 A, HR 4757 A and HR 5422 A are the
hot components of three binary systems whose cool star is a

post-T Tauri object. The systems belong to the so-called
Lindroos binary sample (Lindroos 1985). We will discuss their
evolutionary status and their physical link with the corresponding cool stars in Sect. 6.4.

3. The observations
Two sets of observations have been used in this work.
Intermediate resolution, high signal-to-noise spectra in the range
3700–6200 Å were obtained for all the stars with CAFOS (Calar
Alto Faint Object Spectrograph) on the 2.2-m telescope at Calar
Alto Observatory (CAHA, Almería, Spain). The observations
were taken in two campaigns, 28 October–2 November 2004
and 1–4 April 2005. The motivation was to obtain high quality
Balmer line profiles, in particular Hβ, Hγ and Hδ, in order to estimate the stellar gravities (see Sect. 4.2). CAFOS was equipped
with a CCD SITe detector of 2048 × 2048 pixels (pixel size
24 μm) and the grism Blue-100, centered at 4238 Å, giving a
linear dispersion of ∼88 Å/mm (2 Å/pixel), which is equivalent
to a resolving power of ∼2500. A slit width of 130 μm was used,
corresponding to 1.5 arcsec projected on the sky. The usual bias,

dark and dome flat-field frames were taken each night. Standard
procedures were used to process the data. The nominal positions of the Balmer lines were used to self-calibrate the spectra
in wavelength; a second-order polynomial wavelength-pixel was
used. The widths of the lines of the calibration Hg-He-Rb lamps
were used to obtain the width of the instrumental profile of the
spectrograph for each night.
High-resolution echelle spectra were used in the computation of the metallicities (Sect. 4.3). These spectra were taken
during the four EXPORT campaigns in 1998 and 1999 with
the Utrech Echelle Spectrograph (UES) on the 4.2-m William
Herschel Telescope (WHT) at the Observatorio del Roque de
los Muchachos (La Palma, Spain). UES was set up to provide
a wavelength coverage between 3800 and 5900 Å. The spectra
were dispersed into 59 echelle orders with a resolving power of
48 000. The slit width was set to 1.15 arcsec projected on the
sky. Details of the observing runs and the reduction of the UES
observations can be found in Mora et al. (2001).

4. The computation of the stellar parameters
Figure 1 shows a sketch of the whole procedure we follow to
compute the stellar parameters. In the next paragraphs of this
Section we describe in detail every step.
4.1. The effective temperature

The eﬀective temperature is the first quantity needed to start the
computation of the whole set of parameters. The procedure to
estimate T eﬀ followed in this work and also by Merín (2004)
consists of a comparison of the observed spectral energy distribution, more precisely of its photospheric part (see Sect. 6.1
for a discussion on this), with a grid of low-resolution synthetic spectra (Kurucz 1993), with diﬀerent eﬀective temperatures1 and reddened with a range of extinctions, typically from
E(B − V) = 0.1 to 1.2, in those cases when no solution with the
original models was found. The total-to-selective extinction RV
used is 3.1 although some studies (e.g. Hernández et al. 2004)
suggest that a higher value (RV ∼ 5) could be more appropriate
to model the extinction caused by the environment of HAeBe
stars. We will discuss this choice in Sect. 6.4. The synthetic spectra were normalized to the observed SED and the best fits were
chosen after a careful comparison and assessment of each case.
In some cases a degeneracy appeared, i.e. two or more synthetic spectra fit the observed SED reasonably well, therefore additional information (e.g. the best fit between the observed and
synthetic Balmer profiles) had to be used to break it and choose
the correct solution. In Sect. 6.4 we show how to solve this and
other problems found at this first step for some of the objects,
in particular the very complex cases of VV Ser and RR Tau.
The degeneracy cannot be broken using the intrinsic photometric colours of standard stars compared with those of the target
stars: two synthetic spectra corresponding to two diﬀerent sets
of values (T eﬀ , g∗ ) can fit the observed photometric points for
two diﬀerent values of E(B−V), both of them being consistent
with the intrinsic colours of stars of each spectral type reddened
to match the observed colours.
The SEDs are built from simultaneous optical and nearinfrared (near-IR) photometry obtained in 1998 and 1999 (Eiroa
et al. 2001; Oudmaijer et al. 2001). Simultaneity of the observations is a key point at this step, since for highly variable objects,

have any noticeable eﬀect on the estimation of the eﬀective temperature.

the use of photometry from diﬀerent epochs could lead to wrong
results. Among our data, the photometry corresponding to the
maximum of the stellar brightness, i.e. obtained when the star is
likely to be less obscured, is used in building the SED. We work
here under the hypothesis that the obscuration is caused by the
disk, and hence, that the brightest set of magnitudes in the optical
and near-IR – up to the wavelength where the thermal emission
from the disk starts – represents the stellar photosphere.

Some stars were observed in the range 1200–3200 Å by
the International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) space observatory;
these observations2 are used with caution to complete the SEDs,
due to the variable nature of most of the objects and the nonsimultaneity of the UV data with the optical and near-IR observations3 . In addition to the method outlined in the first paragraph
of this subsection, the comparison between the unreddened synthetic spectra and the ultraviolet part of the SED is particularly
useful to have a better estimation of the extinction. AAVSO4
magnitudes, when they had been measured almost simultaneously with the IUE observations, are used to place at the same
level the ultraviolet and the optical/near-IR parts of the SED.
Table 2 gives the results for the eﬀective temperatures found
in this work and adopted throughout. In a few cases, specified in
the table, values of the eﬀective temperature from other sources
have been used. A typical upper limit of the uncertainty in the
determination of this parameter is of the order of ±200 K.

4.2. Stellar gravities

Stellar gravities are estimated by comparing the wings of the
Balmer lines Hβ, Hγ and Hδ with synthetic profiles extracted
from Kurucz (1993) model atmospheres. The gravity is obtained
by measuring the wavelengths of the intensity levels I = 0.80
and I = 0.90 – the latter only if the profile is clean enough –
below the normalized continuum on the blue and red sides of the
observed Balmer profiles. These intensities were chosen to avoid
potential uncertainties in the overall shape of the wings near the
continuum arising both from the normalization of the original
spectra and from the presence of weak absorption lines in this
region.
A pair of values, namely λ(blue) and λ(red), is obtained for
each line for the intensity levels mentioned above. Each wavelength is then compared with the corresponding one measured
on a grid of synthetic profiles computed for the eﬀective temperature of the star, and diﬀerent gravities. The initial metallicity adopted is [M/H] = 0.0, i.e. solar. The synthetic profiles are
convolved with the instrumental response function of the corresponding night. The eﬀect of rotational broadening, even for values of v sin i as high as ∼250 km s−1 , is negligible in the upper
part (above I  0.50) of the synthetic Balmer profiles, therefore
this broadening was not applied. Linear interpolation was used to
convert the discrete grid of wavelengths from the Kurucz models
into a continuous functions of log g∗ . The final result for log g∗
is the mean value of the results for each line with an uncertainty
corresponding to the standard deviation σ. The observed Balmer
profiles showing emission or strange features due to the presence
of several components of diﬀerent widths were not used for the
computations of gravities.
In Fig. 2 we see an example of the determination of the stellar gravity. The panel on the left shows the Hβ line profile (solid
line plotted in grey) for BF Ori (T eﬀ = 8970 K) and three synthetic profiles (dotted black lines) corresponding to that eﬀective temperature and values of log g∗ of 3.5, 4.0 and 4.5 (the
higher the gravity, the broader the synthetic profile). The linear interpolation done at the blue and red wings of each profile and the subsequent average for the three Balmer lines give a
value of log g∗ = 3.83 ± 0.12. The panel on the right shows the
CAFOS spectrum for this star in the interval 4000–5000 Å, and
the three synthetic Balmer profiles for Hδ, Hγ and Hβ computed
for T eﬀ = 8970 K and log g∗ = 3.83. In this particular case, the
metal abundance we found was slightly larger than solar, namely
[M/H] =+0.20 ± 0.05 (see below in Sect. 4.3 and Table 2). An
iteration in the estimation of the gravity following the same process, but using that value of the metallicity in the synthesis of
the Balmer lines, gives the same result for this star (see Fig. 1).
All the synthetic profiles shown in Fig. 2 were computed with
[M/H] = +0.20.
4.3. Metallicities

Metal abundances are determined by comparing the profiles of
lines (or blends) extracted from the high-resolution spectra with
synthetic spectra computed using the ATLAS9 and SYNTHE
codes by Kurucz (1993). In this work we have used the GNU
Linux version of the codes available online5 (Sbordone et al.
2004).
Model atmospheres provided by Castelli & Kurucz (2003)
are used as one of the inputs for the synthesis. These models
have more accurate solar abundances, were computed with new

opacity distribution functions (ODFs) and contain further improvements upon previous ODFs Kurucz models (see the paper
by Castelli & Kurucz (2003) for details). The ATLAS9 code allows us to compute, for a given metallicity, a model atmosphere
for any value of the eﬀective temperature and gravity from a
“close” model already present in the Castelli & Kurucz grids.
This step had to be done for all the stars in our sample because
the corresponding model atmospheres did not exist for their values of T eﬀ and log g∗ .
The spectral synthesis was carried out using SYNTHE,
which is actually not a single code, but a suite of programmes.
Apart from the model atmosphere – which contains, among other
things, the atomic fractions of the diﬀerent elements – the list of
the atomic and molecular transitions and the spectral range to be
synthetized are also read. SYNTHE computes the excitation and
ionization populations of neutrals and ions and then produces
the final spectrum. A special module of SYNTHE computes intensities at several inclinations in the atmosphere and uses these,
along with the value of v sin i (see Table 1), to simulate the spectrum of a rotating star.
Spectra corresponding to the same T eﬀ and log g∗ are computed for diﬀerent metallicities and a comparison is made with
the observed spectrum. Most of the stars in the sample have large
values of the projected rotational velocity, therefore it is impossible to analyse individual lines and only an average value of the
metallicity can be extracted. Two regions have been explored to
estimate metallicities, namely that between 4150 and 4280 Å
and the one between 4450 and 4520 Å. In a few stars, those with
low or moderate values of v sin i, individual abundances for each
chemical element could be derived from the spectra, this is the
case for HR 5422 A and BF Ori, and to a less extent, that of stars
with v sin i less than around 150 km s−1 . In this work only average abundances, even for the low-v sin i objects, were computed.
Some stars in the sample show various and complex degrees
of variability; therefore it is important, whenever it is possible, to compare all the spectra available for a given object and
select those spectral features that present little or no variation
from one epoch to another. In Fig. 3 we show two examples
of how important this can be. The top part of the plot shows
two regions of high-resolution spectra of BF Ori. The spectra
taken on 25 October 1998 (dark-grey line) and 30 January 1999
(light-grey line) are shown together with the synthetic spectrum,
which has been overplotted as a black solid line. In the upper
part of each panel, the unbroadened spectrum shows how many

transitions contribute to each blend. It is apparent in both sections plotted, especially in the second panel covering the interval 4570–4600 Å, how some lines change dramatically from one
epoch to another. Other features, which have been labelled with
the identification of the most intense line in the blend, remain almost unchanged. The panel at the bottom shows two spectra of
λ Boo around the Mg ii doublet at 4481.13–4481.33 Å obtained
on 16 May 1998 (light grey) and 29 July 1998 (dark grey). The
first one is best fitted with [Mg/H] = −2.0, whereas the latter
shows traces of high circumstellar activity. No attempt was made
to obtain any value of the abundance from this spectrum.
Figure 4 is also very illustrative of another diﬃculty in estimating the metal abundances for these stars: in some cases,
for a given object, lines of the same element in diﬀerent ionization states are fitted by synthetic spectra with very diﬀerent
metal abundances. The plot shows two regions of the spectrum
of HD 31648, namely around the Mg i line at 8806.76 Å and
around the Mg ii doublet at 4481.2 Å. The observations are not
simultaneous6 ; the Mg i profile is best fitted by a model with
[Mg/H] = −0.10, whereas the Mg ii doublet is best reproduced
with a synthetic model with [Mg/H] = +0.50. Such a discrepancy could be attributed to circumstellar contamination of the
line in the latter case.
4.4. Iterations

As we mentioned at the beginning of this Section, the determination of the eﬀective temperature was done by comparing the
SED of each star with synthetic models with [M/H] = 0.0. The
first determination of the stellar gravity, following the flow chart
shown in Fig. 1, also assumed solar metallicity. The pair (T eﬀ ,
log g∗ ) was used to extract the metallicity. When the value of the
metal abundance obtained was diﬀerent by more than 0.30 dex
from the solar one, we iterated the whole process, i.e. a new effective temperature was estimated and a new gravity was found,
using in both cases models and synthetic profiles computed with
the new metallicity. It turned out that for metallicity diﬀerences
as large as 0.80, the new eﬀective temperature did not diﬀer from
the original determination, therefore only the gravity was recomputed for those stars. A full iteration, i.e. the estimation of new

place the star in an HR diagram log g∗ − log T eﬀ and superimpose the appropriate set of evolutionary tracks and isochrones
for that specific metallicity. This gives directly – or after a simple interpolation between the tracks and isochrones enclosing
the position of the star – the stellar mass and the age. In addition, since there is a one-to-one correspondence between a pair
(T eﬀ , g∗ ) on a given track and a pair (T eﬀ , L∗ /L ), one can also
estimate the stellar luminosity in solar units, and if the observed
– dereddened – stellar flux, F∗ , is known through the SED, then,
an estimation of the distance can also be made. The values of
F∗ are taken from Merín (2004) or determinations carried out
in this work. F∗ is computed by fully integrating the flux of the
dereddened synthetic Kurucz model that is considered to best fit
the photospheric part of the SED.
The evolutionary tracks for a scaled solar mixture from the
Yonsei-Yale group (Yi et al. 2001) – Y2 in their notation – have
been used in this work. The Y2 set contains tracks up to M =
5.2 M , therefore, the tracks from Siess et al. (2000) for masses
above that value were used in a few cases (see Sect. 5.2, for
details).

5. Results
5.1. Gravities and metallicities

Fig. 3. Top: two sections of the UES/WHT spectra of BF Ori along with
the synthetic spectrum. The spectra plotted in dark-grey and light-grey
solid lines – both of them with their continuum normalized to an intensity of 1.0 – were obtained on 25 October 1998 and 30 January 1999,
respectively. The synthetic spectrum, computed for T eﬀ = 8970 K,
log g∗ = 3.83 and [M/H] = +0.20 and broadened with a rotation profile v sin i = 38 km s−1 has been plotted as a black solid line superimposed on the observed spectra. In the upper part of each panel we show
the synthetic unbroadened spectrum – not to scale – for comparison.
Bottom: two spectra of λ Boo around the Mg ii doublet obtained on
16 May 1998 (light grey) and 29 July 1998 (dark grey). The first one is
best fitted with [Mg/H] = −2.0, whereas the latter shows traces of high
circumstellar activity. See text for further details.

values of T eﬀ and log g∗ , was done for λ Boo. One iteration cycle
was suﬃcient to reach the final results.
4.5. Masses, luminosities, ages and distances

As can be seen at the bottom of Fig. 1, the knowledge of the
eﬀective temperature, gravity and metal abundance allows us to

Table 2 shows the values of the eﬀective temperature, gravity and
metallicity (the latter when high-resolution observations were
available) for the stars in the sample. In three cases, namely
HR 26 A, HR 9043 and λ Boo, specified in the table, values
of T eﬀ obtained by other authors with a methodology diﬀerent
from that of Merín (2004) or this work have been used; for the
first two stars the calibrations used in those papers gave more
accurate results than ours, whereas for λ Boo the value adopted
is a mean of the eﬀective temperatures from two works where
detailed studies of this star are made. The fourth column of the
lower part of the table gives a generic value of [M/H], estimated
by comparing the observed spectra with the synthetic ones and
trying to mach the shape and depth of the non-variable blends
composed of many broadened individual lines. The determinations of [M/H] for HR 10, XY Per and VV Ser are marked with
a colon, indicating that they are very uncertain given the large
amount of circumstellar lines contaminating the photospheric
spectra, or the low signal-to-noise ratio in the spectra of the latter
object; therefore these values should be taken with caution.
In Fig. 5 we show selected spectra (grey lines) of most of the
stars in the sample for which an estimation of the metal abundance has been possible and the synthetic spectra (black lines)
computed using the values of T eﬀ , log g∗ and [M/H] given in
Table 2. All the spectra are plotted on the same scale. To show all
together in the same graph we have shifted them upwards by different amounts with respect to the lowest one in each panel. The
short horizontal bars mark where the intensity unity is placed.
Each observed spectrum has been normalized to its corresponding synthetic spectrum. The fits to HR 10 and XY Per are tentative, showing how diﬃcult it is to find a region in the spectra not
contaminated by circumstellar lines.
5.2. Masses, luminosities, ages and distances

In Table 3 we give the results of the determination of masses,
luminosities, ages and distances, following the procedure illustrated in Fig. 1 and outlined in Sect. 4.5. The uncertainties for each value correspond to the propagation of the errors

±σ(log g∗ )7 . Note that in some special cases, e.g. the masses
of VV Ser or T Ori, these uncertainties can have the same
sign, if the position in the HR diagram is such that the points
(log T eﬀ , log g∗ + σ(log g∗ )) and (log T eﬀ , log g∗ − σ(log g∗ )) fall
on tracks with masses both larger (or smaller) than those corresponding to the point (log T eﬀ , log g∗ ) itself (see Fig. 6). For
the nine stars in the upper part of Table 2 for which the computation of metal abundances was not feasible, tracks with solar metallicity have been used. The second column of the table lists the values of F∗ used to estimate the distance from the
stellar luminosity. The last two columns show the distances derived from Hipparcos parallaxes (van Leeuwen 2007, Col. 7) and
taken from other sources (Col. 8). For the former ones, only parallaxes whose uncertainty σ(π) is such that σ(π)/π ≤ 0.15 have
been considered. In Sect. 6.3 we discuss in detail the values of
our estimation of distances – actually, as we will see, upper limits in some cases – compared with other determinations.
From the Y2 set, the tracks with Z = 0.02 (solar) have been
used for those stars with metallicities [M/H] between −0.10 and
+0.10. Assuming that the relationship Fe/Fe = X/X holds (in
number of particles), where X means any element with atomic
number larger than 3, the tracks corresponding to [M/H] = +0.20
would be those with Z = 0.03. Since these tracks are not computed in the original set, the results shown in Table 3 are the
average of the values extracted using the tracks with Z = 0.02
and Z = 0.04. For those stars with [M/H] = +0.50 the set
Z = 0.06 was used. Finally for λ Boo, we used the tracks
with Z = 0.0004, which would correspond to [M/H] = −1.7.
For HD 58647 and BD+31 643 there are no high-resolution observations available to estimate metallicities, therefore we assumed solar abundances to estimate their stellar parameters; on
the other hand, for HR 2174, 17 Sex and RR Tau the metallicities
found are solar or very close to it. The five objects have in common that their locations in the HR diagram give masses above
5.2 M , which is the maximum in the Y2 set, therefore, only for
these stars we use the Siess et al. tracks with solar metallicity.

7
Strictly speaking, one should make a computation of the total uncertainties in the parameters considering the combined eﬀect of the errors
both in eﬀective temperature and gravity. For simplicity we have only
propagated the latter ones, which are the largest on average. In Table 4
and Fig. 7 of the paper by Merín et al. (2004) we can see in detail a
calculation considering both uncertainties together.

In Fig. 6 we show, on the left, the log g∗ –log T eﬀ HR diagram for the stars with metallicities between [M/H] = −0.10
and +0.10, where tracks and isochrones for solar metallicity
have been superimposed, and on the right, the corresponding
log L∗ /L –log T eﬀ HR diagram. The vertical error bars in the
points (log T eﬀ , log g∗ ) correspond to those listed in Table 2
whereas those in the points (log T eﬀ , log L∗ ) are the propagation
of the former from the first HR diagram to the second, hence
their diﬀerent size above and below a given object. A common
horizontal error bar of ±0.01 dex has been assigned to the logarithm of eﬀective temperatures, which corresponds to ±200 K at
T eﬀ = 10 000 K.

6. Discussion
The results concerning the stellar mass, luminosity and age given
in Table 3 are distance-independent determinations. Taking advantage of the knowledge of the stellar gravity we are able to
extract the mass and the age from a log g∗ –log T eﬀ HR diagram,
and then the luminosity from the corresponding point in the
log L∗ /L –log T eﬀ HR diagram.
In other works, e.g. those from Gerbaldi et al. (2001),
Hernández et al. (2004) and Manoj et al. (2006), the authors extract these parameters from a log L∗ /L –log T eﬀ HR diagram,
which implies a knowlegde of the distance to the star, this being quite an uncertain parameter on many occasions. Also, in the
three works mentioned above, solar metallicity is assumed for all
the stars, whereas in our case, specific tracks for each metallicity
are used according to the abundance estimated for each object.
The diﬀerent approaches of both formalisms makes a comparison diﬃcult between the values of M∗ /M , L∗ /L and age from
our work and those from other authors. That is why in Table 3
we only provide for comparison, values of distances from other
works, which are discussed later (see Sect. 6.3), whereas we do
not include any values of masses, luminosities and ages other
than those found in this paper. A detailed comparison of results
for these parameters would be lengthy and cumbersome.
6.1. General considerations on the effective temperatures

The whole exercise carried out in this paper can be considered
as a work of basic astrophysics, in the sense that it concerns the
determination of fundamental parameters of a particular class of

Fig. 5. Selected observed spectra of the stars studied in this paper (grey lines) and synthetic spectra (black lines overplotted on each spectrum)
computed with the metallicities [M/H] given in Table 2. The spectral range is 4160–4270 Å. All the spectra have been normalized and plotted on
the same scale, and have been shifted upwards with respect to the lowest ones. The small horizontal bars below the identification of the stars mark
the intensity level unity for each pair of spectra. To have an idea of the range of intensities each spectrum covers, we have indicated the levels
I = 0.8 and I = 1.0 corresponding to 49 Cet and WW Vul in both panels. The spectra of HR 5422 A, BF Ori and VV Ser are not shown; the first
two stars have low values of v sin i, therefore the lines are extremely narrow and the plots would look clumsy, the latter has a rather noisy spectrum
and the resuls are uncertain. Two sections of the spectrum of BF Ori and the corresponding synthetic spectrum are shown in Fig. 3.

stars. The process has been far from simple, due to the nature
of the objects studied, i.e. most of them are not “normal” stars
in the sense that their environment has a clear influence on the
photometric and spectroscopic properties.
As we mentioned, the correct determination of the eﬀective
temperature, the only initial parameter required to start the whole
process, is a key problem of this study. The calculation of T eﬀ
hinges on the fit of the SED, using synthetic models, from short

wavelengths (optical or UV) to a wavelength in the infrared, λ0 ,
where a change in the slope indicates that the contribution from
the disk starts to be noticeable. The photospheric part of the SED
can be aﬀected by circumstellar (and interstellar) extinction, disk
occultation and, in addition, there can be non-photospheric contributions in the UV (e.g. emission from accretion shocks or hot
winds). In the determination of the eﬀective temperatures carried out both by Merín (2004) and in this work, done by fitting

Notes to Table 3: A discussion on the derivation of the distances in Col. 6 is given in Sect. 6.3. The distances given in Col. 8 are taken from the
works by 1 Hernández et al. (2004), 2 Blondel & Tjin A Djie (2006), 3 Manoj et al. (2006) and 4 Eiroa et al. (2008); see those works for the original
references. For HR 26 A, HR 4757 A, HR 5422 A and 49 Cet we give the solutions derived using both Post-MS and PMS tracks, respectively (see
Sect. 6.4).

Kurucz models to the observed SEDs and given in Table 2, it was
assumed that the spectral energy distribution from the UV to λ0
originates entirely in the stellar photosphere. This hypothesis underlies the whole procedure and should be critically assessed in
each case8 . In Sect. 6.4 we analyse in detail – among other stars –
VV Ser and RR Tau, for which the determination of the eﬀective
temperature is especially problematic.
6.2. Comparison with other abundance determinations

Apart from the values of [M/H] around +0.80, for 24 CVn and
XY Per, +0.50 for WW Vul, and the already well-known low
metallicity of λ Boo, the remaining values of the abundances

Since the UV observations are not simultaneous with the optical and
near-IR photometry, we cannot estimate the non-photospheric contributions to the total UV flux; however, even if these represent ∼10% of that
flux, the results would not diﬀer very much, to within the uncertainties,
from those under the working hypothesis we use.

found in this work are solar or fairly close to it. In addition to the
stars analysed in this paper, the two HAeBe stars studied by our
group (Merín et al. 2004), namely HD 34282 and HD 141 569,
show metallicities lower than solar, −0.80 and −0.50 respectively. No trend in the behaviour of the metallicities is observed
in the results for our sample.
As we mentioned in the Introduction, Acke & Waelkens
(2004) carried out an abundance study of 24 Herbig Ae/Be and
Vega-type stars searching for the λ Bootis phenomenon. For
20 of these stars the projected rotational velocities, v sin i, are
less than 100 km s−1 , therefore the authors were able to determine elemental abundances instead of average values, as in our
case. Stellar gravities were not estimated in that paper. In order
to compare their results with ours we have computed a “mean”
metal abundance from those individual values. Details on how
this was done are given in Appendix A.
Guimarães et al. (2006), as a result of a study of the accretion in Herbig Ae/Be stars, also determined stellar gravities and
metal abundances for 12 stars. The methodology of their work is

almost identical to the one we have used in this paper and also in
the analysis of HD 34282 and HD 141569 (Merín et al. 2004).
They provide results for [Fe/H]. Apart from the extreme Fe abundance of HD 100546 (not studied in this work), namely −1.4,
in agreement with the value −1.30 given by Acke & Waelkens
(2004), the abundances for their sample vary from −1.0 to +0.5.
The three samples are not large enough to draw any definitive statistical conclusion, although it is apparent that both in
our work and in Acke & Waelkens’ (2004) the majority of the
stars tend to lie around metallicities close to the solar one. The
highest metallicities found in any of the three works are around
+0.80 whereas the lowest ones are below −1.0.
There is only one star in our sample in common with Acke
and Waelkens’, namely HD 31648 (they found [M/H] = +0.33 ±
0.08 and [Fe/H] = +0.07±0.10), and another one with Guimarães
et al., namely HD 163296 (their result is [Fe/H] =+0.50 ±
0.10). Our results are [M/H] = 0.00 ± 0.05 for HD 31648 and
[M/H] =+0.20 ± 0.10 for HD 163296, in both cases somewhat
lower than the determinations of those two works.
6.3. The estimation of the distances

Since the estimation of the distances hinges first on the determination of the point (log T eﬀ , log g∗ ) and then in the “translation”
of this point to a value of (log T eﬀ , log L∗ /L ), any error in the
derivation of the eﬀective temperature or the gravity would propagate to the final value of the distance.
As can be seen in Table 3 there are 11 stars for which
Hipparcos parallaxes are available such that σ(π)/π ≤ 0.15 –
i.e. implying reliable distances. The comparison between our
estimations and the Hipparcos-derived distances, illustrated in
Fig. 7, shows that in all those cases both determinations agree to
within the uncertainties. This is an additional indication of the
internal coherence of the overall results.
The remaining stars in Table 3 either do not have Hipparcos
measurements or if they do, the large uncertainties make them

reliable parallaxes (see text for details), plotted against the corresponding distances estimated in this work (y-axis).

unusable. Instead, their distances have been estimated using a
variety of methods; in most cases the numbers found in the literature are the distances to the clouds where they could be embedded, which are, obviously, rough approximations. In Col. 8 of the
Table we give results from the compilations made by Hernández
et al. (2004), Blondel & Tjin A Djie (2006) and Manoj et al.
(2006). It can be seen that in some cases those distances are
comparable to our results (e.g. T Ori, UX Ori, XY Per, WW Vul)
but for other stars the discrepancies are large. We can see a systematic trend between our results (Col. 6) and those from other

B. Montesinos et al.: Parameters of Herbig Ae/Be and Vega-type stars

authors (Col. 8): out of 11 cases, in nine of them the distances
derived in this work are larger than the distance to the parent
cloud; the case of RR Tau is especially noticeable.
After exploring what might be the origin of this, we think
that there is an important fact that should be taken into account in
interpreting these discordant results. Note that to derive the distance d, we have used the well-known expression L∗ = 4πd2 F∗ ,
where L∗ is the stellar luminosity and F∗ is the observed photospheric flux, corrected for reddening. To provide the correct
distance, that simple expression must contain the total flux, i.e.
it is implicitly assumed that the whole stellar photosphere is visible to the observer. If this does not occur, F∗ would be underestimated and, since the stellar luminosity has been fixed, the
implied distance would be larger than the real one. It could happen that, if the inclination of the circumstellar disk is high or
the opacity of part of its material is very large (or both), the disk
would block a fraction α of the stellar light, allowing only a fraction F∗ = (1 − α)F∗ (total) to reach the observer. Since the material of the disk can be very inhomogeneous, α would parameterize a mean “filling factor” for the occultation and obscuration of
the stellar light caused by extremely high values of the extinction
(note that the observed flux F∗ still can be aﬀected by circumstellar and interestellar extinction). In addition, as we pointed out
in 4.1, the SED is built taking the brightest photometry among
the available observations, which might not necessarily correspond to the true maximum brightness of the star: if that is the
case, the photospheric flux also would be less than the real one.
These arguments would resolve the discrepancies we mentioned above. In Sect. 6.4 we discuss in detail the cases of
VV Ser and RR Tau, and we see how this eﬀect could have some
impact on our calculations.
Thus, the distances derived in this work and given in Col. 6
of Table 3 should be used with caution. In particular, for those
objects with high values of the extinction or high inclination angles of their disks (e.g. almost edge-on disks, as it happens in
the UXORs), they must be taken as upper limits of the actual
distances.
6.4. Notes on individual stars
6.4.1. VV Ser

This star is an intriguing HAeBe object. The determinations of
its parameters found in the literature are discrepant, showing
large diﬀerences on many occasions. A summary of the results
on the spectral type, luminosity class and rotational velocities
can be found in Table 1 of Ripepi et al. (2007). Assignations
such us A0 V, A3 II, A2 III or B6 for the spectral type and values of v sin i from 85 to 229 km s−1 can be found (see references
in the paper by Ripepi et al.). Concerning the eﬀective temperature, a wide range from 9000 ± 1000 K (Ripepi et al. 2007) to
13 800 K (Hernández et al. 2004) is found9.
The estimates of the distance to the Serpens molecular cloud,
where the star is possibly embedded, also have many uncertainties. The most recent studies converge to a somewhat shorter distance: 225 ± 55 pc for the front edge of the particular region of
the cloud studied (south of the cloud core) and a depth of 80 pc
for the cloud complex (Straižys et al. 2003). Eiroa et al. (2008)
assign a distance of ∼230 ± 20 to the Serpens cloud (see that
reference for a complete review of the properties of this region).
9
An even more extreme value of ∼7000 K is suggested by Ripepi
et al. (2007). According to these authors, it allows them to reproduce
the periodicities of the p-modes of the δ Scuti-like pulsations observed
in VV Ser.

911

There are no direct determinations of the distance to VV Ser
itself, and the values found in the literature are linked to the distance to the cloud.
The initial value of T eﬀ for VV Ser we took to compute the
stellar parameters, according to the scheme presented in Sect. 4,
was 11 000 K, obtained by Merín (2004), which is in between
the available determinations. The comparison of the synthetic
Balmer profiles with the observed ones led to a value of log g∗ =
3.22 ± 0.12, which implied the following set of parameters:
−467
+0.1
M∗ = 7.22−0.95
+1.00 M , L∗ = 1638+261 L , Age = 0.2−0.1 Myr and,
after combining the luminosity and the observed flux, an upper
limit to the distance d = 2224−344
+170 pc.
In Fig. 8 (top) we show the observed SED of VV Ser from
the ultraviolet to the infrared, along with two fits to the photospheric part, which covers the interval between 1200 Å and
9000 Å (I band); from this wavelength onwards, the contribution from the disk dominates. Note that the ultraviolet spectra,
obtained with the IUE observatory, are not simultaneous with
the optical and near infrared photometry (see caption of Fig. 8
for the dates); to our knowledge, there is no optical photometry
available for the dates when the IUE observations were made,
therefore it was not possible to compare the brightness of the
star in the two epochs in order to scale the data. In the graph on
the top left we can see how the SED is fitted reasonably well
with a Kurucz model10 with T eﬀ = 11 000 K and log g = 3.5,
reddened with E(B − V) = 0.9.
If this solution were correct, it would imply too young an
age for the system star+disk, incompatible with its apparent evolutionary status, according to the scenario proposed by Malfait
et al. (1998) (see Sect. 5 and Fig. 3 therein for further details).
Note that, according to the arguments presented in 6.3, the value
d = 2224 pc is an upper limit to the distance, and therefore, the
remaining set of parameters found cannot, in principle, be immediatly ruled out. If the star were actually placed at 250 pc, a simple calculation shows that α  0.99, i.e., if the disk would completely block such a large fraction of the photospheric light, this
solution should be still coherent. This object was classified as an
UXOR star (Herbst & Shevchenko 1999; Rodgers 2003), which
implies, according to the model proposed by Grinin (1988) and
Grinin et al. (1991), a moderate-to-high value for the inclination
angle of the disk. In the work by Pontoppidan et al. (2007a) a
best-fitting model for the disk of VV Ser is presented, giving
a value i = 71.5 deg and a estimated range for this parameter
of 65–75 deg. Also, the Spitzer images of VV Ser and its surroundings shown by Pontoppidan et al. (2007b) suggest an almost edge-on position for the disk.
It is not unexpected that the eﬀective temperature for this
star is an elusive parameter. Figure 8 (graph on the top right)
shows a fit to the SED using a Kurucz model computed with
T eﬀ = 14 000 K, close to the value proposed by Hernández et al.
(2004), namely 13 800 K, and log g∗ = 4.0. The Kurucz model
has been reddened with E(B − V) = 1.10. This fit also seems
reasonable, and the question is whether there is a way to decide
which one of the two solutions, if either, is correct.
10

The fits to the SED shown in Fig. 8 (and later in Fig. 10) have
been performed with models already existing in the grids provided
by Kurucz. There is a negligible diﬀerence between the models with
T eﬀ = 11 000 K and log g∗ = 3.0, 3.5, therefore, either of the two models, at the level of accuracy we can reach in these fits, is indistinguishable from the model with log g∗ = 3.22. The same argument holds for
the models with T eﬀ = 14 000 K and log g∗ = 4.0, and T eﬀ = 13 800 K
and log g∗ = 4.02.

UV spectra were obtained with the International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE); the leftmost – and more noisy – spectrum is SWP 48866 (dark grey,
obtained on 7/10/1993)) and the two spectra to its right are LWP 26520 (dark grey, 7/10/1993), and a merge of LWP 28921 and LWP 28931 (light
grey, 18–19/10/1994); these are the only spectra obtained by IUE of this object. The optical U BVRI photometry was obtained on 24/10/1998. Top
left: The SED has been fitted by a Kurucz model with T eﬀ = 11 000 K, log g∗ = 3.5, reddened with E(B − V) = 0.90. Top right: the SED has been
fitted by a Kurucz model with T eﬀ = 14 000 K, log g∗ = 4.0, reddened with E(B − V) = 1.10. Bottom: the observed Hδ line of VV Ser (grey line)
and two fits with synthetic models (black lines). Bottom left: the best fit achieved using T eﬀ = 11 000 K and log g∗ = 3.22. Bottom right: the best
fit for T eﬀ = 13 800 K and log g∗ = 4.02.

In this case, the solution with a higher eﬀective temperature seems likely to be the correct one. The comparison of the
shapes of the observed and synthetic Balmer profiles for T eﬀ =
11 000 K, under the assumption that the star has a normal photosphere –which is implicit for all the stars in this work– did not result in a totally satisfactory fit. The shape of the Balmer profiles
suggests a larger eﬀective temperature. Figure 8 (bottom) shows
the Hδ observed profile and the best fits for T eﬀ = 11 000 K
and 13 800 K. The latter temperature provides a better global fit
between the observed and synthetic Balmer profiles, and in addition, leads to a set of final parameters, shown in Tables 2 and 3,
which is more coherent with the apparent evolutionary status
of the star; in particular, it sets an upper limit to the distance
at 614−88
+99 pc. In this case, again assuming a distance of 250 pc
to the star, the fraction of photospheric light blocked would be
α = 0.83. We have adopted the solution with the higher temperature as the best we can currently deduce from the available
data, although given the complexity of the system, the issue is
still open.

VV Ser is the star in the sample for which the largest amount
of extinction was needed to reasonably fit the photospheric SED.
In Sect. 4.1 we mentioned that the total-to-selective extinction
RV = 3.1 was used instead of a larger value (RV ∼ 5) suggested
by some studies that could be more appropriate to treat the environment of HAeBe stars (Hernández et al. 2004). Figure 9 shows
the SED of VV Ser plotted in the same way as in Fig. 8 (upper
panels). The black dotted line represents the Kurucz model with
T eﬀ = 14 000 K, log g∗ = 4.0 reddened with the extinction law
with RV = 3.1 and E(B − V) = 1.10 (also shown in Fig. 8,
upper-right panel) whereas the black solid line represents the
same Kurucz model, reddened with E(B − V) = 0.80 but using
the extinction law with RV = 5.0; the parametrization given by
Cardelli et al. (1989) has been used. While the results of the SED
fitting are roughly comparable and acceptable for both values of
RV for the optical and near-IR parts of the SED, the ultraviolet
part cannot be fitted with the RV = 5.0 law; if one attempts to fit
the ultraviolet part, the amount of extinction needed is such that
it is impossible to fit at the same time the UV and the optical and

and dots) and two fits to its photospheric SED. The black dotted line
(shown as a solid line in the upper-right panel of Fig. 8) corresponds
to a Kurucz model with T eﬀ = 14 000 K, log g∗ = 4.0 reddened with
the extinction law with RV = 3.1 and E(B − V) = 1.10. The black solid
line is the same Kurucz model reddened with with E(B − V) = 0.80 but

near-IR intervals. Since the extinction law with RV = 3.1 allows
us to consistently treat the range of wavelengths from UV to the
near-IR, that value of RV was considered the most appropriate
for the analysis. The extinctions needed to fit the SEDs of the
remaining stars are lower than for VV Ser, therefore we decided
to use the same law for all the objects, giving an homogeneous
treatment to the whole sample.
6.4.2. RR Tau

This object is a highly variable HAeBe star also classified as a
UXOR-type (Thé et al. 1994; Oudmaijer et al. 2001; Rodgers
et al. 2002). The determination of its absolute parameters is very
diﬃcult because the variability observed does not allow us to discern clearly what properties remain unchanged, and hence can be
attributable to the – non-variable – stellar photosphere, and what
are due to the presence of circumstellar material passing in front
of the star.
Figure 10 shows the SED of this system from the ultraviolet
to the infrared, plotted in the same way as we did for VV Ser
in the previous paragraph. Given the high degree of variability
of this star and the diﬀerent epochs when the ultraviolet IUE
spectra and the optical photometry were obtained, it is not trivial to compare the sets of observations. A simple way, accurate
enough for the purpose of this analysis, is to scale the ultraviolet observations to the UBVRI points according to the value
of V in both epochs. The ultraviolet spectra shown in the figure were obtained between JD 2449268.446 and 2449268.622
(mean JD 2449268.534). We have found in the AAVSO archives
that V = 12.3 on JD 2449268.4 and V = 11.8 on JD 2449269.4,
with the brightness increasing with time before and after these
two dates. An interpolation between the magnitudes on the mentioned dates and JD 2449268.534 gives V = 12.2 for the moment
when the IUE observations were obtained. Since V = 10.92
when the optical photometry was taken, we have shifted the
ultraviolet spectra upwards by 0.512 dex to make both sets of

lines and dots) and the fit to the photospheric contribution (black

Explorer (IUE); in light grey lines the spectra SWP 48866 (7/10/1993))
and a merge of LWP 26522 and LWP 26254 (7–8/10/1993) are plotted. Taking into account the value of the V magnitude in the epochs
when the ultraviolet observations were obtained (V = 12.2), and
when the U BVRI photometry (dark grey dots) was taken (V = 10.92,
31/01/1999), the IUE spectra have been shifted upwards by 0.512 dex
(dark grey lines) in order to make “comparable” the observing conditions of the two epochs. The SED is fitted with a Kurucz model with
T eﬀ = 10 000 K, log g∗ = 3.5, reddened with E(B − V) = 0.50.

observations comparable11. The best fit to this SED is obtained
with a Kurucz model with T eﬀ = 10 000 K, log g∗ = 3.5, reddened with E(B − V) = 0.50.
The value of the gravity deduced for this eﬀective temperature by using the Balmer profiles is log g∗ = 3.31 ± 0.13, which
implies the following set of parameters: M∗ = 5.79−0.94

luminosity and the observed flux, a distance d = 2103+535 pc.
Note that the age is fairly low to be in agreement with the evolutionary scenario desribed by Malfait et al. (1998). The value of
the distance implied by this solution seems to be quite large compared with estimates made for this star, which place the object
at around 800 pc (Finkenzeller & Mundt 1984). As happened
with the low eﬀective temperature case for VV Ser, the solution
found for RR Tau could be made compatible with that value of
the distance if a fraction α = 0.86 of the stellar light were completely blocked by the disk. The classification of RR Tau as a
UXOR star would favour a moderate-to-high inclination for the
disk, justifying this assumption.
Looking for a solution with a higher eﬀective temperature,
we have explored the accuracy of the fits between the SED and
the models of a grid with eﬀective temperatures from 11 000
to 14 000 K (steps of 1000 K), reddened with colour excesses
E(B − V) from 0.50 to 0.90. Unlike what happened in the case
of VV Ser, we have not found a solution that fits reasonably well
the observed SED, therefore we have adopted for RR Tau the
eﬀective temperature, gravity and stellar parameters shown in
Tables 2 and 3. Our results are consistent with those reported
11

Note that this scaling is grey, in the sense that we have moved the
ultraviolet spectrum upwards by the same factor for all wavelengths.
The correct approach would be to take into account the wavelength
dependence of the extinction, which would imply also a wavelengthdependent scaling factor.

Notes to Table 4: the results shown in the upper part of the table are
from Gerbaldi et al. (2001), those in the lower part are derived in this
work. The tracks used for computing the ages are: 1 Schaller et al.
(1993), 2 Girardi et al. (2000), 3 D’Antona & Mazzitelli (1998), 4 Palla
& Stahler (1999), 5 Y2 post-MS, 6 Y2 PMS.

by Grinin et al. (2001; T eﬀ = 9750 K, log g∗ = 3.5, solar
metalicity) and Rodgers et al. (2002; 9000 ≤ T eﬀ ≤ 10 000,
3.0 ≤ log g∗ ≤ 3.5).
6.4.3. HR 26 A, HR 4757 A and HR 5422 A

These three stars were included in the sample as hot companions of post-T Tauri stars, extracted from the Lindroos catalogue
(Lindroos 1985). Gerbaldi et al. (2001) carried out a systematic study of a sample binary systems with post-T Tauri secondaries. Both components, A and B, of HR 26 (HD 560), HR 4757
(HD 108767) and HR 5422 (HD 127304) were analysed in detail
in that work and eﬀective temperatures, gravities, luminosities,
masses and ages were computed. The eﬀective temperatures and
gravities were obtained by those authors from calibrations using both ubvyβ and Geneva photometry; the luminosities, masses
and ages were estimated in a diﬀerent way from that followed in
this paper: using the Hipparcos parallax and the V magnitude of
each star, they computed Mbol and then L∗ /L , placing the star
in a log L∗ /L –log T eﬀ HR diagram and from its position, the
remaining parameters were derived.
Table 4 shows a comparison of the results from Gerbaldi
et al.’s work and ours. The results shown in the upper part are
extracted from Tables 1 (eﬀective temperatures and gravities),
7 and 9 (ages of the early and late-type stars, respectively) of
Gerbaldi et al. (2001); those in the lower part are from Tables 2
and 3 of this work. For the late-type stars we list the ages found
by Gerbaldi et al. (2001) in order to have all data needed for the
discussion of the results.
One should not be confused with the terminology “hot companion of a post-T Tauri star” attributed to these stars in the sense
of assuming as a real fact that they are physically linked to the
late-type companion. Gerbaldi et al. (2001) came to the conclusion that for HR 26, the ages of the components were compatible
with a physical association between them due to the overlap of
the error bars of the ages. The lack of that overlap lead these authors to conclude that the components of HR 4757 and HR 5422

are not linked (see Table 4). Note, however, that the result on
HR 26 hinges on a large error in the determination of the age
of the late-type star, therefore, in our opinion, that claim is very
uncertain.
Strictly speaking, with only the data corresponding to the effective temperature and gravity (or luminosity), it is impossible
to say whether these three stars are in a PMS or a post-MS evolutionary stage. When the corresponding points (log T eﬀ , log g∗ )
– or (log T eﬀ , log L∗ /L ), if the V magnitudes, bolometric corrections and Hipparcos distances are used – are placed in the HR
diagram, they lie above the main sequence. In Fig. 11 we can see
two HR diagrams, on the left we have plotted our results on the
Y2 tracks and isochrones for PMS stars and on the right, on the
Y2 set for the post-MS. In Tables 3 and 4 we give the results derived for both cases. The PMS ages are low, less than 3 Myr in all
cases, whereas the post-MS ages are in the range 150–300 Myr,
consistent with the results by Gerbaldi et al., although slightly
larger.
The SEDs do not show any remarkable infrared excess:
HR 26 A and HR 5422 A do not have IRAS detections, and
HR 4757 A has IRAS fluxes at 12 and 25 μm lying slightly
above the photospheric continuum and only upper limits at 60
and 100 μm. HR 26 A has a detection at 1.3 mm above the photospheric continuum (Altenhoﬀ et al. 1994). However, the absence of an infrared excesses cannot, in principle, rule out the
results extracted from PMS tracks, since it is not guaranteed that
all A-type PMS stars in the age range 1–10 Myr have large infrared excesses indicating the presence of a circumstellar disk.
None of the stars show Hα in emission.
Pallavicini et al. (1992) carried out optical spectroscopy of
post-T Tauri star candidates. HR 26 B (G5 Ve) and HR 4757 B
(K2 Ve) show strong Ca ii emissions and Li absorptions, which
are indications of youth, whereas HR 5422 B (K1 V) does not
have Ca ii emission and the Li absorption is weak, which implies that this object must be older than the other two stars. The
ages derived by Gerbaldi et al. for the “B” components, listed in
Table 4, are consistent with those observations, but in all cases
they are larger than (under the assumption that the “A” components are PMS objects) or smaller (assuming that the “A” components are post-MS stars), by very significant diﬀerences, the ages
of the corresponding early-type companions. Therefore, we can
conclude that in none of the three cases are the pairs physically
linked.
6.4.4. 49 Cet and other stars without Hα emission

In Table 1 we indicate what stars show the Hα line in emission.
It is well known that stars without disks with eﬀective temperatures in the range of those considered in this work show the Hα
line – and all the lines of the Balmer series – in absorption. The
presence of emission in PMS stars with protoplanetary disks is
an indication of winds (Finkenzeller & Mundt 1984), accretion
(e.g. Muzerolle et al. 2005), or a combination of both (Kurosawa
et al. 2006)12 . Since the typical lifetime of protoplanetary disks
is a few million years (Alexander 2008), these phenomena are
an indication of youth, and therefore the status of PMS assumed
a priori for all the stars in our sample with Hα emission is coherent.
However, the fact that a star does not show Hα in emission
does not imply, in principle, that the object has abandonned the
PMS phase. In our sample there are stars with no emission but
12

If the star is of a spectral type later than F, the Hα emission also will
have a chromospheric contribution.

showing remarkable infrared excesses, indicative of the presence
of a disk.
The case of 49 Cet is especially interesting. The peculiarity
of this object is that its disk has retained a substantial amount of
molecular gas, which is a typical feature of protoplanetary disks
(i.e. ages less than ∼10 Myr) but shows dust properties similar
to those of debris disks (Hughes et al. 2008). The spectrum, as
can be seen in Fig. 5, is purely photospheric, and does not show
any signature of circumstellar activity.
In Table 3 we give the stellar parameters for this object using both PMS and post-MS tracks and isochrones. Figure 11
shows the position of the star in two HR diagrams; on the left,
the Y2 PMS tracks and isochrones have been used, on the right,
the post-MS set has been plotted. Thi et al. (2001) assigned an
age of 7.8 Myr to 49 Cet using PMS tracks, which is in good
agreement with our PMS determination. Our estimations of the
eﬀective temperature and gravity place the star almost on the
main sequence, therefore its evolutionary status can be that of a
star either on the PMS phase, entering the MS, or just evolving
out of it. Actually, the uncertainties in the gravity are such that
they allow the star to be exactly on the main sequence.
In the region of the HR diagram where 49 Cet lies, it is
particularly diﬃcult to carry out an estimation of ages: the
isochrones are very close to each other and therefore a small
change in gravity implies a large change in age. In the case of
this star, the range of ages covered assuming that the star is in
a PMS phase or in a post-MS stage is 8.9–61 Myr, hence any
age in between these two determinations could be a reasonable
result. Hughes et al. (2008) suggest that the disk might be in an
unusual transitional phase and our results are in agreement with
this hypothesis.
As can be seen in Table 1, in addition to HR 26 A, HR 4757
A and HR 5422 A, already studied in the previous subsection,
there are other stars without Hα emission. Those objects have
been classified as A-shell or Vega-like stars, implying that the
corresponding infrared excesses are not very large. However,
these stars deserve further and more detailed study since the ages
derived from PMS tracks (see Table 3) are in all cases less than
6 Myr and some objects, e.g. HR 10 and λ Boo show a high
degree of circumstellar activity.

7. Final remarks
Eﬀective temperatures, gravities, metallicities, masses, luminosities, ages and distances (or upper limits) have been obtained
for a sample of 30 early-type objects, more precisely 27 HAeBe,
Vega-type and Ash stars, and three hot – suspected and finally
ruled out – companions of post-T Tauri stars. The results obtained are described in detail in Sect. 5 and discussed in Sect. 6.
We stress the diﬃculty of finding the correct stellar parameters for these kinds of objects. As we have seen in the cases
of VV Ser and RR Tau, shown in Sect. 6.4, the spectral energy
distributions are diﬃcult to interpret and the assumption that
the ultraviolet, optical and near infrared parts of the SED originate entirely in the photosphere must be assessed in each case.
Simultaneity of the observations in all wavelength ranges is crucial to build a consistent SED; in this work we have used ultraviolet data that were obtained long before the optical and near
infrared data; this must be always be present in the analysis of
the SED. Also, the wings of the Balmer lines used to compute
the gravity are supposed to be purely photospheric, without any
external contamination. Note that these hypotheses, underlying
the whole procedure, are the starting points to determine the remaining set of stellar parameters. The extinction caused by the
environment and the variability of the objects can also mask the
‘true photosphere’, if that concept is applicable to these kinds of
stars.
On the other hand, the uncertainties in the determination of
temperatures and gravities place a limit on the accuracy of the
ages estimated using isochrones. As it can be seen in Figs. 6
and 11, depending on the region of the HR diagram where a
given star lies, the shape and position of the isochrones provide
in some cases a wide range of ages. In particular, when the star
lies very near the main sequence, as it happens to 49 Cet, even
the determination of the evolutionary status as a PMS or postMS object can be a problem.
In view of these considerations we suggest to take the ages
found in this paper – and in general, all the determinations of
ages at this evolutionary stage using isochrones – with caution,
assessing each particular case in a critical way and complementing their values with those of an observable quantity, such as
FIR /F∗ , i.e. the ratio between the excess flux from the disk and

916

B. Montesinos et al.: Parameters of Herbig Ae/Be and Vega-type stars

the photospheric flux, which can be taken as a proxy for the age
of the system.
We would also like to remark that the method proposed
to obtain the stellar parameters is distance-independent, in the
sense that it is based on the determination of the eﬀective temperature and gravity, which are used, via a transformation from
a log g∗ − log T eﬀ HR diagram into a log L∗ /L − log T eﬀ HR
diagram, to compute the remaining parameters. The method has
proven to be reliable, given the agreement between the distances
found in this work and those available from Hipparcos measurements (see Sect. 6.3 and Fig. 7). For those stars with unknown
distances, our determinations are upper limits to the real values.
The tasks carried out in this paper, resulting in the characterization of the stars, are necessary steps to study and model
their circumstellar disks. Work is already in progress to show a
global picture of the behaviour of the disks of these stars and
their interaction, via accretion processes, with the star.

In this Appendix we treat the problem of how to compute a
meaningful “mean metal abundance” from measurements of individual elemental abundances. Let us consider the case of a set
of elemental abundances, some of which have been obtained using lines of two diﬀerent ionization stages.
Let xi ( j) be the elemental abundance of the element i obtained using absorption lines of its j-th ionization stage, i.e.
xi ( j) = [Ai ( j)/H] and let Δxi ( j) be the corresponding error.
In the particular case when an element has diﬀerent measurements of the abundances using lines of two ionization stages,
namely I and II, we obtain the abundance of that element by averaging the individual values weighted by a factor equal to the
inverse of the square of their errors:

according to Eq. (4).
Acke & Waelkens (2004) provide the values of [Ai /H] and
use the solar abundances by Anders & Grevesse (1989), so in
principle, it is not diﬃcult to compute an average abundance to
be compared with ours. The problem, however, is a bit more
subtle and a direct comparison is not as trivial as it may appear.
Acke & Waelkens (2004) divide the results in three tables: their
Table 2 contains the C, N, O and S abundances; Table 3 contains
the abundances of “metals”, where by “metals” they mean Mg,
Si, Ca, Ti, Fe and Sr, and Table 4 contains the abundances of
other elements, namely Na, Al, Sc, V, Cr, Mn, Ni, Zn, Y, Zr
and Ba.
Instead of computing the mean metallicity using all the elemental abundances, the criterion we have chosen is to include
only abundances of the “metals”. These averages, and their uncertainties, are shown in the second column of Table 5. The reason for this is that, since the atomic fractions of C, N, O and S

B. Montesinos et al.: Parameters of Herbig Ae/Be and Vega-type stars

are much larger than those of the remaining elements, these four
elements would dominate the whole mean value. As the optical
spectrum of early-type stars is dominated by lines of “metals”,
the abundances we have computed for the stars in our sample
are, in fact, related to to those species and not to the lighter elements, namely, C, N, O and S.
For comparison we give in the third column of Table 5 the Fe
abundances. Note that they can be quite diﬀerent from the mean
abundances obtained from the metals. This comes from the fact
that the elemental abundance ratios in these stars diﬀer in general
from the solar ones, so the abundances of other “metals”, mainly
Mg and Si, have a strong weight on the mean abundance.
