HD 80606 b
HD 80606 b (also Struve 1341 Bb or HIP 45982 b) is HD 80606 b
an eccentric hot Jupiter 217 light-years from the Sun in
the constellation of Ursa Major. HD 80606 b was
discovered orbiting the star HD 80606 in April 2001 by
a team led by Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz.[2]

With a mass 4 times that of Jupiter, it is a gas giant.
Because the planet transits the host star its radius can
be determined using the transit method, and was found
to be about the same as Jupiter's. Its density is slightly Computer simulation of weather systems on
less than Earth's.[6] It has an extremely eccentric orbit HD 80606 b, to scale with Jupiter
like a comet, with its orbit taking it very close to its

HD 80606 b has the most eccentric orbit of any known planet after
HD 20782 b. Its eccentricity is 0.9336, comparable to Halley's
Comet. The eccentricity may be a result of the Kozai mechanism,
which would occur if the planet's orbit is significantly inclined to
that of the binary stars. This interpretation is supported by
measurements of the Rossiter–McLaughlin effect, which indicate
that the planet's orbit may be significantly inclined (by
42 ± 8°)[10][11] to the rotational axis of the star, a configuration
which would be expected if the Kozai mechanism were
responsible for the orbit.[4]

As a result of this high eccentricity, the planet's distance from its
star varies from 0.03 to 0.88 AU. At apastron it would receive an
insolation similar to that of Earth, while at periastron the
insolation would be around 800 times greater, far more than that

Orbital motion of HD 80606 b. experienced by Mercury in the Solar System. In 2009, the eclipse
of HD 80606 b by its parent star was detected, allowing
measurements of the planet's temperature to be made as the planet

passed through periastron. These measurements indicated that the
temperature rose from around 800 K (500 °C / 1000 °F) to 1500 K
(1200 °C / 2200 °F) in just 6 hours.[12]

An observer above the cloud tops of the gas giant would see the

+85
The planet's rotation period has been measured to be 93 −35 hours,

longer than the predicted pseudo-synchronous rotation period of 40 hours.[5]

Weather
The planet has wild variations in its weather as it orbits its parent star. Computer models predict the
planet heats up 555 K (1,000 °F) in just a matter of hours, triggering "shock wave storms" that ripple out
from the point facing its star, with winds that move at around 5 kilometres per second (3.1 mi/s;
11,000 mph).[12][14]
