Looking for Exoplanets-Distances
• There are 3,600 arcseconds in one degree

Inverse Square Law

• One parsec is 206,265 AU (or 3.26 light-years)
• One parsec is the distance to an object whose
parallax angle is one arcsecond
• One parsec is 3.26156378 light years

~ 1,367 w/m2

Looking for Exoplanets-Distances
• Astrometry and Direct Imaging rely on capturing
light from distant stars
• Great distances to stars and the Inverse Square
Law result in extremely low levels of light intensity
at Earth
• At the surface of the Sun the intensity of the solar
radiation is
• ~ 6.33×10 7 W/m 2 (watts, per square meter)
• At Earth (1AU) the Sun’s intensity is ~1,367 W/m 2
• Light year-The distance that light travels in a
vacuum in one year, approximately 9.46 trillion
kilometers (5.88 trillion miles)
• 1 LY =63,066 AU
• 100 LY=6,306,600 AU
• Sun’s intensity at 100 LY =0.000001592 that at
Earth (1.592E-6)

100 LY = 30.65 parsecs

Looking for Exoplanets - Astrometry
• Astrometry consists of precisely measuring a star's position in the sky, and observing how that position
changes over time
• Originally, this was done visually, with hand-written records
• Late in the 19th century, the use of photographic plates greatly improving the accuracy of the
measurements
• It also created a data archive
• If a star has a planet, then the gravitational influence of the planet will cause the star itself to move in a tiny
circular or elliptical orbit
• Effectively, star and planet each orbit around their mutual center of mass (barycenter)
• Since the star is more massive, its orbit will be much smaller
• The mutual center of mass (barycenter) may lie within the radius of the star
• It is easier to find high mass planets around low-mass stars, especially brown dwarfs

Looking for Exoplanets - Astrometry
• Astrometry is the oldest search method for exoplanets
• It was originally popular because of its success in characterizing astrometric binary star systems
• It dates back at least to the late 18th century
• Unfortunately, changes in stellar position are so small—and atmospheric and systematic distortions so
large—that even the best ground-based telescopes cannot produce precise enough measurements
• All claims of a planetary companion of less than 0.1 solar mass, as the mass of the planet, made before
1996 using this method are likely spurious
• In 2002, the Hubble Space Telescope did succeed in using astrometry to characterize a previously
discovered planet around the star Gliese 876
• Atmosphere bends light chaotically, causing telescopic images to waver and smear
• Atmosphere is responsible for poor transparency when it absorbs and scatters light, causing faint
objects to appear even fainter than they really are

Looking for Exoplanets - Astrometry
• GAIA is a European Space Agency (ESA), space
observatory launched in 2013
• It is expected to operate until c. 2022
• It uses astrometry - measuring the positions,
distances and motions of stars with great precision
• Its mission is to construct the largest and most
precise 3D space catalog ever made
• Including approximately 1 billion astronomical
objects
• Stars, planets, comets, asteroids and quasars, etc

• The spacecraft monitors each of its target objects
about 70 times over the first five years of the
mission to study the precise position and motion
of each target
• GAIA is expected to detect thousands to tens of
thousands of Jupiter-sized exoplanets beyond the
Solar System!

• GAIA data is released in stages
• The first data release, GAIA DR1 was in 2016
• It was based on 14 months of observations made
through September 2015

Looking for Exoplanets - Astrometry
• Planets are far less massive than stars, but they still
exert a gravitational pull on them
• The gravitational forces between a planet and its
star causes the pair to orbit a shared center of
mass that is often within the star itself, although
not right in the middle
• The result is that the star appears to wobble as it
moves in a tiny orbit around the shared center of
mass
• The pull of Jupiter on the Sun, for example, causes
the Sun to wobble with an average velocity of 12
m/s as it orbits a center of mass close to its surface

• The astrometric method relies on detecting this
almost imperceptibly small wobble in stars situated
many light years away- high demands on the
sensitivity of instruments
• A Sun-sized star 42 light years away (ten times
further than our closest neighboring star, Proxima
Centauri) would wobble by only a fifth of a
millionth of a degree under the influence of a
planet like Jupiter
• This is equivalent to seeing the International Space
Station from the Earth moving 1.5 mm in its orbit
• The effect of an Earth-sized planet would be some
1600 times smaller
• Very few of known exoplanets have been found
using the astrometric method

Looking for Exoplanets – Direct Imaging
• So far, only a handful of planets have been
discovered by Direct Imaging

• Direct Imaging consists of capturing images of
exoplanets directly by searching for the light
reflected from a planet’s atmosphere at infrared
wavelengths

• While challenging compared to indirect methods,
this method is the most promising when it comes
to characterizing the atmospheres of exoplanets

• At infrared wavelengths, a star is only likely to be
about 1 million times brighter than a planet
reflecting light

• Chemical composition via spectroscopy

• At visible light wavelengths, a star is typically a
billion times brighter than a planet’s reflected light

• So far, 100 planets have been confirmed in 82
planetary systems using this method
• Many more are expected to be found in the near
future

Looking for Exoplanets – Direct Imaging
• Direct Imaging is is less prone to false positives
• The Transit Method is prone to false positives in up to 40% of cases involving a single planet system
(necessitating follow-up observations)
• Planets detected using the Radial Velocity Method require confirmation
• Why it is usually paired with the Transit Method
• Direct Imaging allows astronomers to actually see the planets they are searching for
• By examining the spectra reflected from a planet’s atmosphere, astronomers are able to obtain vital
information about its composition
• This information is intrinsic to exoplanet characterization and determining if it is potentially habitable

Looking for Exoplanets – Direct Imaging
• Direct Imaging works best for planets that have wide orbits and are particularly massive (such as gas giants)
• It is also very useful for detecting planets that are positioned “face-on”, meaning that they do not transit in
front of the star relative to the observer
• This makes it complimentary to radial velocity, which is most effective for detecting planets that are “edgeon”,

Looking for Exoplanets – Direct Imaging
• Direct Imaging is rather difficult because of the obscuring effect light from a star has
• It is very difficult to detect the light being reflected from a planet’s atmosphere when its parent star is so
much brighter
• Opportunities for Direct Imaging are very rare using current technology
• For the most part, planets can only be detected using this method when they orbit at great distances from
their stars or are particularly massive
• This makes it very limited when it comes to searching for terrestrial (aka. “Earth-like”) planets that orbit
closer to their stars
• Direct Imaging method is not particularly useful for searching for potentially-habitable exoplanets

Looking for Exoplanets – Direct Imaging
• The first exoplanet detection made using this
technique occurred in July of 2004, when a group
of astronomers used the European Southern
Observatory’s (ESO) Very Large Telescope Array
(VLTA)
• They imaged a planet several times the mass of
Jupiter in close proximity to 2M1207 – a brown
dwarf located about 200 light years from Earth
• A brown dwarf is a star like object that is not
massive enough to sustain nuclear fusion in its
hydrogen core
• Image of a planetary-mass object in orbit around
brown dwarf 2M1207, taken by a group of
astronomers led by Gael Chauvin in July of 2004

• It does not have high surface temperature or
luminosity like a “real” star

Looking for Exoplanets – Direct Imaging
• In 2005, further observations confirmed
this exoplanet’s orbit around 2M1207
• However, some have remained skeptical
that this was the first case of “Direct
Imaging”, since the low luminosity of the
brown dwarf was what made the detection
of the planet possible
• In addition, because it orbits a brown dwarf
has led some to argue that the gas giant is
not a proper planet

• In September of 2008, an object was imaged with a
separation of 330 AU around its host star, 1RXS J160929.1210524 – which is located 470 light-years away in the
Scorpius constellation
• However, it was not until 2010 that it was confirmed to be a
planet and a companion to the star
• The planet , 1RXS J160929.1-210524 b , is about 8 times
mass of Jupiter
• Orbital radius is 330 AU
• It take 6505.9 years to complete one orbit of the star

Looking for Exoplanets – Direct Imaging
• On November 13th, 2008, a team of astronomers
announced that they captured images of an
exoplanet orbiting the star Fomalhaut using the
Hubble Space Telescope
• The discovery was made possible thanks to the
thick disk of gas and dust surrounding Fomalhaut,
and the sharp inner edge which suggests that a
planet had cleared debris out of its path
• Follow-up observations with Hubble produced
images of the disk, which allowed astronomers to
locate the planet
• Another contributing factor is the fact that this
planet, which is twice the mass of Jupiter, is
surrounded by a ring system that is several times
thicker than Saturn’s rings, which caused the
planet to glow quite brightly in visual light

• HST was launched into low Earth orbit in 1990
• It features a 7 ft 10 in mirror
• Its five main instruments observe in the ultraviolet,
visible, and near-infrared
• HST's orbit outside the distortion of atmosphere
allows it to capture extremely high-resolution images
with substantially lower background light than
ground-based telescopes

• Fomalhaut was the first stellar system with an
extrasolar planet candidate (designated Fomalhaut
b, later named Dagon) imaged at visible
wavelengths
• Analysis of existing and new data suggests
Fomalhaut b is not a planet, rather an expanding
dust disk resulting from a former collision
• The image was published in Science in November
2008

Looking for Exoplanets – Direct Imaging
• Advantages

• Disadvantages

• For humans "Seeing is believing"

• With current observation technology, direct
imaging is possible on very rare occasions

• Direct imaging can provide scientists with valuable
information about the planet
• Direct imaging works best for planets that orbit at
a great distance from their stars so that they are
not lost in the star's glare
• It also works best for planetary systems that are
positioned face-on when observed from Earth

• It is most likely to succeed when conditions are just
right, namely when a bright planet orbits at a
great distance from a nearby star
• Because of these strict limitations, direct imaging is
not a good candidate for large-scale surveys
searching for new exoplanets

• This makes it complementary to the radial velocity
method, which is most effective for planetary
systems positioned edge-on to Earth and planets
orbiting close to their parent star
