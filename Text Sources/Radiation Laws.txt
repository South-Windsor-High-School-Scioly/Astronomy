Radiation laws
Blackbody radiation
Any substance (solid, liquid or gas) emits radiation
according to its absolute temperature, measured in
units of Kelvin (K = oC + 273.15). The efficiency at
which radiation is emitted varies with the substance.
However, at any temperature, there is an upper limit to
how much radiation can be emitted.
A blackbody is a hypothetical body that:
1) Emits radiation at the maximum intensity possible
for every wavelength.
2) Completely absorbs all incident radiation (hence
the term “black”).

Note: The sun has an effective radiative temperature of about
6000 K but terrestrial objects have temperatures only
of the order of 300 K.
At different radiative temperatures, the area under the
Planck curve changes and the spectral quality of the
radiation shifts along the wavelength axis.
These two effects are described by two well-known laws:
one based on integration of the Planck equation to
yield the total radiant energy emitted, and the other
based on differentiation of the equation to obtain the
peak wavelength of the spectrum.
(How does one obtain the total radiation emitted and
how does one obtain the peak of the wavelength of the
spectrum?)

blackbody is proportional to the fourth power of the
absolute temperature such that,

It is instructive to plot the spectra of solar and
terrestrial radiation on the same diagram to show their
relative contributions at different wavelengths. Before
doing so, however, it is necessary to make the
following changes:
1) Solar radiation is reduced according to the inverse
square law to the mean orbital distance of earth.
2) Solar radiation is further reduced (by a factor of
4) to express it in terms of unit surface area of
the globe (surface area of a sphere is 4 times that
of a circular disc).
3) Wavelength is plotted on a log scale because of the
large range of wavelengths involved in the two
radiation streams.
4) Irradiance is multiplied by the wavelength ( E * ) so
that equal areas on the graph respect equal amounts
of radiant energy.

The solar “constant” S
The solar constant is the solar irradiance incident on
a surface perpendicular to the sun’s ray at the mean
orbital distance of the earth and outside the
atmosphere. This represents the amount of solar
radiation available for warming the earth and for
driving its atmospheric and oceanic motions.
We can calculate the solar constant knowing its radiant
output, its radius and the orbital distance of the
earth, using the inverse square law.

If the same amount of radiant energy passes through
areas A1 and A2, the irradiance (flux of energy per

thus to the squares of the radial distance from the
origin.

Emissivity
Real objects emit radiation at a rate lower than that
of a blackbody (a perfect emitter). The efficiency of
emission by an object at a given temperature is
wavelength dependent. For example,

the efficiency with which a surface absorbs solar

For example, fresh snow has a high albedo (reflectivity
to solar radiation) meaning a low absorptivity to solar
radiation. Yet, snow is a very good emitter of longwave
radiation (high emissivity). Under the right
circumstances, snow can melt more quickly on a cloudy
night than on a sunny day.

Energy balance of the earth/atmosphere system
Since radiant energy is the only mechanism by which the
earth/atmosphere system can exchange energy with space,
there must be a state of radiation balance (the earth
loses as much radiant energy as it gains from the sun),
assuming that the earth’s temperature is approximately
steady-state, and is not increasing or decreasing
forever. This enables us to calculate an effective
radiating temperature for the earth, as it would be
observed from outer space.

This is a globally averaged effective radiating
temperature and is probably equivalent to some upper
atmospheric temperature. The earth’s surface has an
observed globally averaged temperature much warmer than
this, close to 15 oC. The explanation for this is the
well-know “greenhouse” effect.
Note: If we have chosen an emissivity for the earth such as
0.9 to adjust the Stefan-Boltzmann radiation, we
would have calculated an effective temperature of 262 K
(-11 oC) still much colder than observed temperatures
at the earth’s surface.

Solar radiation
The attached diagram shows the spectral composition of
solar radiation. Based on the position of the peak of
the spectrum, the sun appears as a blackbody with
temperature near 6000 K but absorption by gasses in the
solar “atmosphere” reduces the overall emission, and
the sun appears as an object with an effective or
radiative temperature of 5784 K.
Solar irradiance changes with time, season, and
location for the following reasons:
1) The solar “constant” changes due to changes in the
output of the sun ( 0.1% )
2) At different times of the year the distance between
the sun and the earth is different because the
earth’s orbit is slightly elliptical. The sun and
earth are closest in January (S-hemisphere summer)
and furthest apart in July (N-hemisphere summer).
The 1.7% difference in the distance translates to a
3.4% difference in irradiance because of the
inverse square relationship.
3) Different parts of the earth are exposed to
different amounts of solar radiation, depending on
the time of the day and time of year, change of the
zenith angle of the sun (angular distance from the
overhead position).
4) The path length of solar radiation through the
atmosphere varies as a function of zenith angle,
causing depletion by scattering and absorption.

Radiation and the atmosphere
Of great importance is the difference between how the
atmosphere transmits, absorbs, and scatters solar and
terrestrial radiation streams. The most important
statement that one could make is that the atmosphere is
relatively transparent to solar radiation but is
relatively opaque to terrestrial radiation.
In the absence of dense clouds, a large fraction of the
incident solar radiation penetrates the atmosphere and
reaches the surface. Most of the radiation (longwave)
emitted by the earth surface is absorbed by the
atmosphere but, because the atmosphere is a good
absorber, it is also a good emitter (Kirchhoff’s law)
and reemits a large portion of the absorbed energy back
to the surface. This is the “greenhouse effect”.
Scattering of solar radiation
The scattering of sunlight in atmosphere is responsible
for the blue color of the sky in clear conditions and
also for the lack of color when the air is laden with
pollutants (unless pollutants are also selective
absorbers in which case the sky, especially the lowest
layers when viewed from the side, can appear a murky
brown).
The blue or colorless appearances of the sky result
from two distinct types of scattering:
1) Rayleigh scattering is by particles (molecules and
groups of molecules, in this case) much smaller
than the wavelength of the radiation. Rayleigh
scattering is very wavelength dependent such that
the scattering coefficient (a measure of the
efficiency of the scattering)

Thus, blue light is much more strongly scattered
than red light, accounting for the blueness of the
sky and for the red color of sunsets. The blue sky

2) Mie scattering is by particles of the same order of
size as the wavelength (such as solid particles or
small liquid droplets in polluted or hazy air), and
is relatively independent of wavelength. As a
result, the sky appears white or colorless when
heavy with pollutants.
See also the following diagram presenting a general
picture of scattering in the atmosphere.
Show a scattering diagram
Transfer and absorption of solar radiation
Generally, a cloud-free atmosphere absorbs most solar
radiation (short-wave) weakly. However, the shorter
wavelengths (
0.3 m ) are eliminated at high
altitudes by N2, O2 and O3. Strong absorption by ozone
at about 50 km produces the temperature maximum at this
height (the stratopause). In the near infrared, water
vapor has several rather weak absorption bands. See the
following two diagrams for details.
Show a diagram for absorptivity
Clouds absorb some solar radiation but are mostly
responsible for scattering and for reflection of solar
energy back to space. The earth’s albedo of 0.3 is
largely a consequence of the amount of cloudiness.

12

ATM60, Shu-Hua Chen
Atmospheric absorption of terrestrial radiation
The spectral absorptivities shown in the following
diagram clearly show the large differences between
absorption and transmission of solar and terrestrial
radiation. Again, the atmosphere is relatively
transparent to solar radiation but nearly opaque to
terrestrial radiation. Recalling that the spectrum of
terrestrial radiation spans a range from about 4 m to
100 m with a peak at about 10 m , we see that most
radiation emanating from the earth surface would be
absorbed by the atmosphere, with water vapor and CO2
being the principle absorbers.
An atmosphere “window” appears in the absorption
spectrum near the peak in the spectrum of terrestrial
radiation (~10 m ) allowing some longwave radiation to
escape to space under cloud-free conditions. This
“window” in this part of the spectrum is utilized by
satellite IR imagery to observe cloud cover and other
features both day and night.
Clouds are very strong absorbers of longwave radiation.
The earth/atmosphere energy budget
Being a good absorber of longwave radiation, and
according to Kirchhoff’s law, the atmosphere is also an
excellent emitter of radiation of the same spectral
composition. Clouds are also good emitters of
terrestrial radiation according to their temperature,
so warm (usually low) clouds emit more strongly than
cold (usually high) clouds, as dictated by the StefanBoltzmann law.
This absorption and emission of terrestrial radiation
plays a large role in governing the energy balance of
the earth/atmosphere system and is the reason that
changes in the concentration of “greenhouse” gasses are
likely to have an impact on global climate.
The following diagram summarizes, in a globally
averaged manner, the exchanges of energy that take
place between the earth’s surface, the atmosphere, and
space. All the numbers are normalized to 100 units of
incoming solar radiation. Note the large magnitudes
associated with longwave radiation, some of the numbers
even larger than that of the ultimate energy source,
the sun.
