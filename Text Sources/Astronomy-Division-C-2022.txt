1. DESCRIPTION: Teams will demonstrate an understanding of the Variability of Low &
Mid-Mass Stars.
2. EVENT PARAMETERS:
a. Each team may bring one of the following options containing information in any form and
from any source:
i. a computer/tablet and a three-ring binder; or,
ii. two computers/tablets, of any kind; or,
iii. two three-ring binders.
b. If three ring binders are used they may be of any size and the information contained should be
attached using the available rings. The information or pages may be removed during the event.
Sheet protectors and laminated sheets are allowed.
c. Each team may bring two calculators of any type (stand alone or computer app). If the
participants are using a computer/tablet they may use the calculator app or other program on
their device in place of a stand-alone calculator.
d. Participants using computers/tablets as a resource should have all information stored so that it
is available to them offline. However, teams may be asked to access a dedicated NASA image
analysis website to answer some JS9 questions. If so, supervisors will provide an alternative
(e.g., proctor-supplied computer or screen shots) for teams that did not bring a laptop/tablet.

1. DESCRIPTION: Teams will demonstrate an understanding of the Variability of Low &
Mid-Mass Stars.
3. THE COMPETITION: Using information which may include Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams,
spectra, light curves, motions, cosmological distance equations and relationships, stellar
magnitudes and classification, multi-wavelength images (gamma-ray, X-ray, UV, optical, IR,
radio), charts, graphs and JS9 imaging analysis software, teams will complete activities and
answer questions related to:
a. Stellar evolution including stellar classification, spectral features and chemical composition,
luminosity, blackbody radiation, color index and H-R diagram transitions, proto-stars, T Tauri
variables, Herbig-Haro (HH) objects, red giants, Mira variables, RR Lyrae variables,
carbon stars, white dwarfs, planetary nebulas, neutron stars, dwarf & recurrent novas,
Type Ia supernovas, magnetic cataclysmic variables (MCVs).
b. Use orbital mechanics, Kepler’s laws, rotation and circular motion to answer questions
relating to the orbital motions of binary and multiple star systems; use parallax, spectroscopic
parallax, period-luminosity relations, and the distance modulus to calculate distances to RR
Lyraes, and Type Ia supernovas; use hydrostatic equilibrium and the Stefan-Boltzmann law to
answer questions relating to stellar structure and interiors.
