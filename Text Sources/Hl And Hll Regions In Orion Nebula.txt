ABSTRACT
We have used the Hubble Space Telescope to image two regions of the Orion
Nebula in low and high ionization emission lines. There appear to be two
main systems of Herbig Haro objects in the Orion nebula { a `North' System
is centered slightly north of the BN and IRc2 sources, and a `South' System
centered south of the Trapezium stars. The North System appears to be the
result of shocks on the near side of OMC-1, the host molecular cloud for M42.
The sources of these HH objects is most likely to be instabilities in shocks driven
by massive star winds penetrating into a region of decreasing ambient density.
HH 201 displays many of the characteristics of the North System members but
lacks a trailing H2 nger. HH 208 and 209 share this latter property and also
display a very di erent morphological form, which puts their association with
the North System in doubt. The South System contains large shocks with a
variety of morphologies. This system is most likely a combination of shocks in
the ionized nebular gas and lower ionization shocks formed when jets from low
mass young stars strike the neutral lid lying on the near side of M42.
Both shocks and photoionization a ect the line excitation of HH objects
in M 42, especially among the South System, where ultraviolet light from
1C Ori penetrates into the back side of a bow shock that moves toward the
observer. Among the bow-shaped objects along the ngers in the North system,
the highest excitation lines occur near the apices of the bows, as predicted by
theory. Objects that lie closer to the Trapezium are more dicult to analyze
because of stronger nebular emission, rendering the HH objects best visible in
[O I] and [S II] emission.

1. Background and Introduction
Studies of stellar jets have focussed primarily on the simplest systems, those ows
which emanate from single, relatively isolated low mass stars. However, multiple ows are
common even among the brightest and best studied regions (e.g HH 1, Reipurth et al. 1993;
HL Tau, Mundt et al. 1990; HH 111, Gredel & Reipurth 1993), and we can expect even
greater source confusion within the clusters of giant molecular clouds if every accretion
disk around a young star drives a jet. The mixture of photoionized and shocked gas also
makes it more dicult to interpret emission lines from jets within H II regions; for example,
emission lines formed as a shock moves through ionized gas closely resemble those from a
higher velocity shock in neutral gas (Cox & Raymond 1985).
In spite of the above complications, enough is now understood about the line excitation
in stellar jets to enable us to study these ows in more complex environments. Extending
the study of stellar jets to dense clusters and H II regions is the the only way to understand
how a typical young star interacts with its environment, because most of the stars in our
Galaxy, including all massive stars, begin their lives in clusters deep within giant molecular
clouds. Understanding line ratios in H II regions also requires that we distinguish shocked
gas from photoionized gas before we measure canonical abundances, temperatures and
densities of the H II region.
At a distance of 430 pc (Warren & Hesser 1977), the OMC-1 cloud and the Orion
Nebula (M 42; NGC 1976) are the the nearest giant molecular cloud and H II region to
the Sun, respectively. On the near side of OMC-1 lies a grouping of >
 700 stars known
as the Trapezium Cluster (Herbig & Terndrup 1988, Prosser et al. 1994, Zinnecker et al.
1993), while  10 to the NW of the Trapezium a cluster of young stars embedded deeply
within the cloud appear as infrared sources. The hottest star in the Trapezium cluster, 1 C
Ori, dominates the photoionization of the surrounding gas and produces a thin blister of

{4{
photoionized material that is the famous Orion Nebula. The Trapezium lies in a zone of low
gas density and is bounded on the near side by an irregular "lid" of neutral (H I) gas. This
lid was originally detected by study of the 21 cm line in absorption against the nebula's
radio continuum (van der Werf & Goss 1989, 1990) and we now know that the irregularities
in the lid produce the patchy extinction seen across the face of the nebula (O'Dell et al.
1992) and the multiple low ionization interstellar absorption lines seen in the brightest stars
(O'Dell et al. 1993).
Because the Trapezium cluster contains so many young stars, it is not surprising that
many HH objects exist within the Orion nebula. The basic geometry in the Orion nebula is
understood quite well (O'Dell & Wen 1992, Wen & O'Dell 1995). Shocks in out ows from
Trapezium Cluster stars should occur either (1) within the low density highly ionized gas
near the hottest stars, (2) within the main ionization front, or (3) in the neutral lid. HH
objects driven by infrared sources within the OMC-1 cloud to the NW of the Trapezium
will be heavily reddened, so optically visible shocks in this region will form preferentially in
or near the photodissociation region (PDR) that lies beyond the ionized surface material.
As observational techniques have improved, astronomers have continued to discover
more HH objects in the Orion Nebula. The rst HH objects discovered in this region,
HH 203 and HH 204 near 2 A Ori were seen in projection against a low surface brightness
part of the nebula (Munch & Wilson 1962, Taylor & Munch 1978). Munch & Taylor (1974)
found HH 201 in an [O I] study while Canto et al. (1980) found HH 202 in a similar
search in [N II] and [S II]. A subsequent [O I] search by Axon & Taylor (1984), Taylor
et al. (1986) added six more objects in the northern part of M42 (HH 205 ? 210). A
recent spectroscopic and imaging study has led to the addition of another object, HH 269
(Walter et al. 1995), to the southwest of the Trapezium. Infrared observations by Allen &
Burton (1993; hereafter A&B) rst showed clearly a uni ed outer structure of \ ngers" of

{5{
H2 emission, most of which had known optical HH objects at their tips. A similar structure
was actually seen in the early images of Taylor et al. 1984 and this work has been further
extended in later studies in H2 (Schild et al. 1996; McCaughrean & MacLow 1996).
The paradigm that we will use for discussion of individual HH objects is that they
are all shocked gas whose energy and velocity arises from material owing from a young
star. The shocked gas is compressed to higher density and raised to a high electron
temperature and increased ionization while material behind this advancing shock front
cools and recombines toward lower ionization, producing an ionization strati cation that
allows us to estimate the shock velocity and preshock density (e.g. Morse et al. 1993a).
This paper analyzes HST images of two regions of the Orion Nebula already known
to contain HH objects. We rst present the new observational results and show how they
reveal that the known HH objects are but the brightest and best de ned of a large number
of related objects. We then discuss the physics of the brightest HH objects, and conclude
with a discussion of the sources that drive and create M42's HH objects. There are many
high ionization shock structures in the highly ionized central region near the Trapezium
which manifest themselves best in [O III] (Casta~neda 1988, O'Dell et al. 1993b, O'Dell &
Wen 1994) but we will treat these in a future paper that discusses HST observations and
correlated groundbased spectroscopy. Whenever possible, we will refer to the objects by
their numbers in the uni ed designation system of Reipurth (1995).

2. Observations and Data Reduction
We observed two elds with the WFPC2 of the HST, a northern portion on 3 October
1995 and a southern on 14 November 1995 as part of General Observer program GO 5976.
The lters employed were f673n to isolate the [S II] doublet at 6717+6731 
A and the f631n

{6{
to isolate the [O I] line at 6300 
A. The northern eld was determined by the need to t
all of the known northern HH objects into one pointing and the southern was made as
a duplicate of an earlier set of images. The central intersection of the irregular WFPC2
northern eld was at 5:35:13.0 ?5:22:48 (J2000) with a position angle of the SE boundary
of 43 and the center of the high resolution PC portion of the southern eld was at 5:35:22.0
?5:25:09 with a PA = 0 orientation. The full northern eld is shown in Figure 1.
Both elds had been previously covered with WFPC2 images in [O III] at 5007 
A, H I
H at 6563 
A, [N II] at 6583 
A, and the continuum at 5470 
A (O'Dell & Wong 1996). In
addition, we made use of the A&B images in H2 at 2.122 m, [FeII] at 1.644 m, and the
J bandpass. The infrared images were made in two parts, a higher resolution (0.2600/pixel)
coverage of the northern eld and a lower (0.6100/pixel) coverage of the entire region. The
infrared line lters used were about 1% of the wavelength, which means that that they also
pass a signi cant amount of scattered light continuum in selected regions. The two infrared
images were merged into a single image before comparison with the HST observations.
Each new WFPC2 image was actually a triple exposure, to allow adequate cosmic
ray correction. The rst steps of data reduction were straightforward, using IRAF2 and
STSDAS tasks to do cosmic ray cleaning, at eld correction, and integrating the four
individual WFPC2 CCD images into a single mosaic. Irregularities at the seams of the
CCDs were cleaned using IRAF tasks. We also made use of WFPC2 images in the same
lters which were obtained as parallel observations during program GO 5469 of John Bally,
who kindly made them availble prior to their entering the public domain.
2 IRAF is distributed by the National Optical Astronomy Observatories, which is operated

by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc. under cooperative
agreement with the National Science foundation.

{7{
Because of the need to compare data from a variety of sources and pointings, we
cast all of the observations into a format with an orientation of north up and carefully
determined the necessary shifts for producing coaligned images. The northern eld is highly
irregular in outline since it combines two sets of data (ours and Bally's). Jumps in the
background are seen at some of the junctures of data sets (both HST and infrared) due to
inaccuracies of the at eld corrections. We have allowed these to remain since they are
cosmetic rather than substantial and actually help to delineate the boundaries between the
data sets. Position references were always obtained using the stars from the list of Jones
& Walker (1988) after applying a +0:059s correction in Right Ascension to all their values
(O'Dell & Wong 1996 and references therein).
We concluded our data reduction by preparing color coded images of each eld. In
our detailed analysis we used various color combinations and examined the high quality
monochromatic images in considerable detail. The [O I] and [S II] images were very similar
in the HH objects and could often be used in combination to improve the signal to noise
ratio. In addition, much of the background nebula's contribution could be removed from
them by subtracting the combined H and [N II] images, rendering the [O I] and [S II]
much more visible.

3. HH Systems in Orion and the Engines that Power Them
HH objects typically consist of a series of bow shocks that mark the location of
radiative shocks along a jet. Stellar jets emanate from young stars surrounded by accretion
disks, so it is usually possible to identify the star responsible for the out ow in those cases
where HH objects are aligned. A cursory examination of the images reveals at least two
di erent systems of HH objects in the Orion nebula region. We show below that the rst
system is itself composed of at least two distinct subsystems.

{8{

3.1. The North HH Object System
We will call the rst system the North System and discuss it in this section. As we'll
see, it actual breaks down into an Inner and Outer pair of systems. The possibility of its
existence was rst articulated in the proper motion study of Jones & Walker (1985) who
pointed out that HH 201, 205, 206, and 210 seemed to be moving rapidly away from a
common center near the location of IRc2, thus extending the argument of Axon & Taylor
(1984) that there could be such a system associated with the compact infrared sources
embedded in OMC-1. These arguments were strengthened by the publication of the infrared
images of A&B which not only showed intense H2 regions clustered about IRc2 and BN,
but also faint H2 ngers which extended to projected distances of 0.08 pc from there. The
most recent study of H2 (McCaughrean & Mac Low 1996) isolates the H2 emission better
by accurate subtraction of the nebular and scattered continuum. The new H2 images reveal
an additional nger in approximately the 8 o'clock position from the center, but the images
do not cover the richest region of ngers to the north. In our discussion of these ngers we
will refer to them by clock based analogies.
The North System is illustrated well in Figure 1. In this image we have shown A&B's
H2 image being shown in red, [S II] plus [O I] emission in green and H emission in blue.
The strong di erence in surface brightness in H2 between the ngers and the central region
was suppressed by dividing the H2 image by a low order t to itself. We see that there are
seven H2 ngers. HH 210 falls at the tip of the 11 o'clock nger and HH 206 and HH 207
fall along the edge of the 1 o'clock nger at whose tip lies HH 205. We have outlined the
ngers as they appear on the best video screen displays and have marked in the proper
motions of the HH objects determined in the studies of Jones & Walker (1985) and Hu
(1996b), projected at the present rate back for 400 yrs.
A detailed examination of the images show that ngers 10:30 through 1:30 all have

{9{
[O I] and [S II] emission at or near their tips on the new HST images. The high extinction
expected in the PDR beyond the main ionization front of the Orion Nebula (Tielens &
Hollenbach 1985) together with the appearance of both the H2 and the easily obscured
optical emission indicates that the tips of these ngers must lie close to the ionization front
which forms the near boundary of OMC-1. This conclusion is strengthened by the fact
that there is an excellent correlation of appearance of the combined low ionization optical
[O I]+[S II] lines (Figure 2) and the infrared [Fe II] lines, which should arise from very
similar regions. This means that the northernmost ngers form a rather homogenous set of
objects, probably having common conditions. The fact that the radial velocities of HH 205,
206, 207, and 210 are highly blueshifted (180, 200, 200, 425 km s?1 Axon & Taylor 1984,
Taylor et al. 1986, Allen & Burton 1994, Hu 1996b); all radial velocities in this paper will
be heliocentric unless otherwise noted) is consistent with the ngers being a near surface
phenomenon driven by an inner source.
Examination of the material going into Figure 1 indicates that the ngers falling
between 10:30 and 1:30 determine only an imprecise common center, but one that is about
at the star 138-207 (using the Orion position dependent designation system of O'Dell &
Wen (1994)) which is Jones & Walker (1988) 423 Fig. 2). This center lies about midway
between HH 208 and 209, rather than at IRc2, the usual source that is identi ed. This
is not to argue that 138-207 is indeed the source, rather, that it falls closer to the ill
de ned common center than does IRc2+BN. However, the uncertainty in this center due to
the errors in the proper motions (about 15) is large enough that we cannot exclude the
possibility that the ngers originate from IRc2+BN.
Figure 2 shows the central region of Figure 1 and can be used for discussing whether
or not the inner northern HH objects (201, 208, 209) are related to the system de ned
by the northernmost ngers discussed above. The inner northern HH objects share the

{ 10 {
common property of being quite blueshifted, with radial velocities of 310, 225, and 250 km
s?1 respectively (Axon & Taylor 1984, Burton & Allen 1994, Hu 1996b) and HH 201 has a
similar high proper motion (Jones & Walker 1985, Hu 1996b). HH 201 resembles HH 205
and 210, while HH 208 and 209 are very di erent in form, not at all resembling a shock
seen edge on but could be shocks viewed almost along the line of the driving jet.
Examination of the symmetry of these inner northern HH objects indicates no common
origin for them. HH 201 seems to be the superposition of two quite symmetric and parallel
sources or clumps in a single bow shock. The symmetry axis runs close to both the IRc2
and BN infrared sources and to HH 208, although the uncertainties preclude a detailed x
on a driving source. If the same source that drives the outer northern HH objects also
drives HH 201, the source must lie somewhere south of star 138-207. As seen in Figure 3,
HH 209 has a clumpy structure that lacks any obvious symmetry. A region of [O I] and
[S II] emission exists just to the north of HH 209, and there is also H2 emission immediately
north of IRc9. Together, the optical and H2 emission lie along a line towards the BN+IRc2
region and the apparent common center of the Northern HH objects and HH 201.
Figure 2 shows that HH 208 is accompanied by a collection of clumpy material to its
northwest, which, like HH 208, is highly blueshifted in recent Fabry-Perot images taken by
Hartigan, Morse, & O'Dell (in preparation, hereafter HMO). We may see evidence of a jet
that drives HH 208 and its further associated region in our images. Although dicult to see
in Fig. 2, there is a faint, broad (100) linear feature exactly along the line passing through
HH 208 and its companion shock at a position angle of 305. This linear feature passes
about 100north of 147-234 and fades away near the star 154-240, which is certainly a young
low mass star since it is a well de ned proplyd (O'Dell & Wong 1996). This association is
the strongest evidence for a source of a driving jet in M42 and will be considered in HMO.
Figure 2 shows well a feature marked as 127-147 which is the optically brightest part

{ 11 {
of a low ionization nger extending out towards the WNW. The HMO spectra indicate a
radial velocity of about ?200 km s?1 , so that it too is probably is an HH related object.
There is an additional feature that extends ESE from just above 138-207 which was rst
pointed out by Hester et al. (1991). Figure 2 shows that a faint linear feature extends
beyond that star and points directly at 130-201. Such an alignment may only be fortuitous,
as there is no evidence of high radial velocities in the brighter east part of this feature
(O'Dell et al. 1991).
In summary, we can say that the North HH objects fall into a similar class according
to their velocities. Unlike HH 201, HH 210, and HH 205, which show clear bow shock
shapes, the shocked gas in and around HH 208 and 209 is more clumpy and irregular. All
of the North HH objects are consistent with a common center just south of 138-207, with
the exception of HH 208, which may originate from the pre-main sequence star 154-240.

3.2. The Southern HH Object System
The division of the M42 HH objects into Northern and Southern Groups is based
on their apparent centers. All of the objects included in the northern system are either
near or have a symmetry center in the BN+IRc2 region. Those we group as the Southern
HH Objects don't have such a simple delineation, but clearly stand in contrast with the
Northern HH Objects. The brightest members of the Southern Group are HH 202, 203, and
204, and we will also present arguments in this section for there being several additional
members. All of these objects di er from the Northern Group objects, in that they lack H2
emission and are about an order of magnitude larger in size.
The brightest members of the Southern Group can be seen well in the color HST
mosaic image of M42 presented by O'Dell & Wong (1996). HH 202 is located to the WNW

{ 12 {
from 1 C Ori and HH 203-4 are in the SW part of M42 very near the hot star 2 A Ori. The
proximity of HH 203-4 to such a bright star led Taylor & Munch (1978) to argue that the
HH objects represent a stellar wind interaction, a position now superceded by the view that
these objects represent jet driven shocked material. The Orion mosaic image shows well
how HH 202 and HH 203-4 seem to fall on opposite ends of the same line of symmetry, with
a separation of 21000, although this property has been obvious and appreciated for some
time from good ground observations.
HH 202 was discovered by Canto et al. (1980), who showed that at the end of a long
concave form there were two bright knots, as illustrated best in the [S II] image of Figure 4.
The north knot was studied at high spectral resolution in [S II] by Canto et al. and they
determined that the radial velocity peaked at about ?42 km s?1 , indicating a blueshifted
ow of about 68 km s?1 with respect to OMC-1. Similar results were obtained by O'Dell et
al. (1991) who studied the south knot in [O I], [S II], [N II], [O II], [S III], and H . The
latter study was able to determine that there seems to be a large scale shock structure that
is moving at about ?20 km s?1 . Superimposed on this is the south knot, which is moving
at about ?30 km s?1 . Figure 4 shows that the north knot is quite low ionization, while the
south knot possesses strong [O III] emission. There is extended [O III] emission throughout
the long concave form.
The proximity and near alignment of HH 203 and 204 argues that they are related or
at least share a common source, but there are important di erences. The more northerly
of the pair, HH 203 resembles a truncated bow shock. Such a form can be explained as
due to a jet impinging on a cloud with a density gradient (Henney 1995). Although the
agreement with such a model is quite good (Hu 1996b), it may also be possible to explain
the asymmetry in HH 203 from di erences in the pre-shock ionization. HH 204 is a highly
lamentary bright knot at the end of a rather symmetric cone that resembles a bow shock,

{ 13 {
even though the high excitation line of [O III] does not occur at the apex of the bow like it
usually does in other HH objects. As we discuss in the next section, the excitation in this
object appears to be controlled by a mixture of local shocks and external ionization from
1 C Ori. The velocity of HH 203 is about ?50 km s?1 and ?25 km s?1 (Taylor & Munch
1978, Walsh 1982, O'Dell et al. 1993b). The proper motion of Cudworth & Stone (1977)
indicate a tangential velocity of HH 204 of 70 km s?1 .
Both the HH 202 and HH 203-4 regions share the common property of having extended
[O III] emission within an envelope that has low ionization peaks at the apices of the bows.
There is no indication of such a property in any of the northernmost HH objects (which we
believe arise from within OMC-1). While the North HH objects may have a higher density
and hence have a shorter cooling length, a more signi cant di erence in the environments
of the North and South systems is the preshock ionization, which is maintained at a high
level in the southern system by ultraviolet radiation from 1C Ori.
The other cataloged M42 HH object is HH 269, which di ers in many ways from the
others. It is an east-west oriented elliptical ring marked by two bright knots on the ends of
the long axis. A recent study of HH 269 by Walter et al. (1995), where monochromatic HST
images are published, indicates that the object is quite low ionization and the east knot has
V = ?13 km s?1 and the west V = ?23 km s?1 . HH 269 has strong low ionization lines,
but also appears in the [O III] images, probably because it too is illuminated by 1 C Ori.
We know that M42 is primarily a high density blister type H II region on the near side
surface of OMC-1. The Trapezium Cluster of stars, which includes the dominant source
of photoionization 1 C Ori, is located nearer to us than the main ionization front within a
region of low density and high ionization. Overlying all of this is a highly irregular neutral
lid of dust and gas. The low ionization and blue shifts of HH 202, 203+4, and 269 indicated
that they all form in the foreground neutral lid, a conclusion supported by the presence of

{ 14 {
extended [O III] emission in each.
There are numerous additional features that are best associated with the Southern
System. Examination of the HST mosaic image of M42 shows that there is a more
homogeneous ring of similar form and size immediately to the east of HH 269 and that
object in turn is adjoined by a similar size ellipse whose northern edge appears in both
extinction and emission. A line drawn along these three objects intersects the line between
HH 202 and HH 203-4 at a region rich in blue shifted high ionization shocks (O'Dell et al.
1993b). These latter shocks emanate radially from a point near the center of the intersection
of the two lines. This intersection region contains many pre-main sequence low mass stars
and is one of the subjects treated in HMO. The high ionization shocks, which are visible
only in [O III] and H , are probably formed in the low density photoionized gas that lies in
the low gas density region between the main ionization front and the foreground neutral lid.

4. The Shock Excitation Paradigm
The brightest portions of stellar jets typically appear as a series of bow shocks that
form as the young star ejects material in sudden bursts (e.g. Reipurth & Heathcote 1993).
The line excitation at the apex of a bow shock is always higher than in the wings because
the e ective shock velocity is higher at the apex. For example, [O III] emission only exists
near the apices of bow shocks in HH 34S (Morse et al. 1992), HH 111L (Morse et al. 1993b),
and HH 1 (Solf et al. 1988), whereas H and [S II] also emit along the wings of the bow.
Often the shock velocities inferred from the emission line ratios in stellar bow shocks are
several hundred km s?1 lower than the space motions measured from proper motions and
radial velocities, but such di erences can arise if the bow shock moves into the wakes of
previous ejections. Sometimes a reverse shock or `Mach disk' is visible as fast material in
the jet overtakes material behind the bow shock (e.g. Heathcote et al. 1996).

{ 15 {
It is a challenge to apply bow shock models to HH objects in the Orion Nebula
because there are many possible exciting sources and much of the ambient gas is heated by
photoionization. Nevertheless, it is instructive to begin with this paradigm as a starting
point for any object, and we will do so in what follows.
HH 203 and HH 204 resemble bow shocks in morphology, but as Figure 5 shows, the
[O III] emission from this region does not come from the apex of the bows, but instead
occurs primarily in a di use region along the southwestern portion of the objects. We would
expect the apices of HH 203 and HH 204 to lack [O III] if the shock velocities were <
 90 km
s?1 . Both HH 203 and HH 204 are known to be blueshifted and the velocities are relatively
low. The [O I] in the frothy head of HH 204 is considerably more clumpy than [S II],
perhaps because [O I] has a higher critical density than [S II], an interpretation consistent
with the results of Walsh (1982) who found densities well over 104cm?3. The H , [O I],
[N II], and [S II] emission concentrate in clumpy structures that de ne an asymmetrical
bow-shaped structure (HH 203) followed by a more symmetrical bow (HH 204). The
lack of symmetry in HH 203 probably arises from an increasing preshock density towards
the northeast in this object. These `comma-shaped' structures have been observed in
other objects (e.g. Hartigan et al. 1986) and are present in numerical simulations of bow
shocks that propagate through a medium with a lateral density gradient. We attribute the
distribution of [O III] to di erences in the way that 1 C Ori illuminates this region of the
nebula. Hence, in these objects the line excitation tells us little about the shocks.
As in the case of HH 203/204, the [O III] emission in HH 202 (Figure 4) does not
originate primarily at the apex, but instead radiates over the entire cavity. The lower
excitation lines radiate most strongly in a bright region near the apex of HH 202 and
in a region along the north shoulder of the cavity. An additional hemispherical bubble
appears in [O III] and H to the northwest of HH 202 (the direction away from the

{ 16 {
Trapezium). Overall, the proximity of 1 C Ori appears to cause the line excitation HH 202
to be dominated by photoionization, though the observed radial velocities imply that some
shocked gas is mixed in the region (Canto et al. 1980).
Another HH object in the Orion Nebula that resembles a bow shock in both morphology
and line excitation is HH 201. This object has a bright [O III] peak at its apex (Figure 3),
with more extensive H following along the wings and the [S II] outlining the entire
bowshock. As in HH 210, the bow shock seems to be breaking into multiple pieces as it
progresses through the nebula. Given the large radial velocity of this object (?310 km
s?1 ), it is surprising that [O III] does not emit over a larger fraction of the bow shock, since
[O III] should become observable when the component of the velocity perpendicular to the
shock exceeds 90 km s?1 . It is possible to explain this behavior if the preshock medium
moves outward at a substantial fraction of the bullet velocity. This explanation is required
to explain the extent of [O III] in other HH objects as well (see below).
HH 210 is a remarkable object whose [S II] image appears as a delicate extended
nger of emission that points away from 1 C Ori. Though this object has no signi cant H2
emission, it resembles the HH knots seen at the heads of the other H2 ngers in morphology.
The line excitation in HH 210 shows good qualitative agreement with a bow shock model.
Here H and [O III] emit in two bright areas near the apex, with the H extending
somewhat further into the wings than the [O III]. This gradient in line excitation from apex
to wing is expected from a bow shock. The two peaks may arise if the bow is breaking up
into smaller pieces owing to Rayleigh-Taylor instabilites, as has been proposed for some HH
systems (e.g. HH 2). Alternatively, since the forward peak is relatively weaker in [O III], it
may represent a precursor moving ahead of the main bow-shock. The relative lack of H
emission from the [S II] emitting wake is unexpected, as H typically outlines the location
of shock fronts in stellar jets. However, the wake disappears into a bright H background

{ 17 {
caused by the Orion nebula in the southern portion of HH 210, and this background makes
it dicult to observe the shock structures there in H . The southern portion of HH 210
dips into the [O III] region excited by 1C Ori.
Like HH 210, HH 205 lies far enough from 1C Ori so that its line excitation is not
dominated by photoionization. HH 205 clearly de nes a bow shock, both in morphology
and in line excitation. The [O III] is con ned to a small arcuate region near the head of the
bow, with H extending more into the wings and [S II] emitting over the entire bow shock.
These morphologies are in agreement with a bow shock model. Proper motion of the system
is in the direction of the head of the bow, as is also true for HH 210. Both HH 205 and
HH 210 have high enough space velocities to account for [O III] emission at their apices.
The wings of the bow shocks in HH 201 and HH 210, and to a lesser degree HH 205, all
exhibit a triangular shape in the [S II] images of Figs. 3 and 6. The bow wings of HH 201
and HH 210 de ne opening angles of 29 and 25, respectively. We can calculate the Mach
number from these angles if we know the inclination to the objects. High resolution spectra
of the [O I] line pro le by Hu (1996) suggest orientation angles of between 0 and 15 ( =
90 if the bow shock moves in the plane of the sky). However, if HH 201 and HH 210 were
really coming almost directly toward the observer, it is dicult to understand why these
objects have such pronounced conical shapes. If we adopt the full velocity width of the
[O I] pro les from Hu (1996) as a measure of the true velocity of these objects (cf. Hartigan
et al. 1987) then the observed proper motions imply   33 for both HH 201 and HH 210.
The intrinsic opening angles for HH 201 and HH 210 are then  14, which corresponds to
a Mach number of 8. For a sound speed of 16.6 km s?1 (at T=104 K), this implies a bow
shock velocity of 133 km s?1 . This is consistent with the observation of [O III] emission only
at the bow shock tip, but it is not consistent with the line widths of order 300 km s?1(Hu
1996). The large line widths can be reconciled with the bow shock opening angles if the

{ 18 {
Mach angle corresponds to an Alfven speed of about 35 km s?1 . This in turn requires a
magnetic eld of several hundred microGauss in the compressed post-shock ow Raymond
et al. 1988).
To the south of HH 205 along the same H2 nger are HH 206 and HH 207, and to
the east of these is a complex of knots we call HH 207 E (Figure 6). HH 206 resembles
its northern neighbor both in its bow shock morphology and in its line excitation. As
in HH 210 and HH 205, HH 206 has [O III] emission at the apex, followed in the wings
by H and [S II]. HH 207 appears to be a low-excitation analog of HH 206, with the
bow well-de ned in [S II], H more con ned towards the apex, but no [O III]. While this
scenario is consistent with a low velocity (<
 90kms?1) bow shock, such a low excitation is
puzzling in light of the high radial velocity and proper motion of this object. The easiest
way to explain a high velocity low-excitation HH object is if the object moves into the
wake of a previous ejection, so that the e ective shock velocity is the di erence between
the velocity of the knot and that of its preshock gas. Such a scenario makes sense for
HH 207, which follows in the wake of HH 206 and HH 205. An extremely strong magnetic
eld can also lower the line excitation in a shock (Hartigan, Morse & Raymond 1993). The
complex of low-excitation [S II] knots in HH 207E does not outline a well-de ned bow shock
morphology and nothing is known about the proper motions and radial velocities of these
objects. Hence, it is premature to draw any conclusions about these objects here.
HH 208 and HH 209 both appear only in the [S II] and [O I] images and show a
de cit of [O III] surface brightness in the nebular background. The strength of the low
ionization lines relative to H indicate that they are formed in low velocity shocks, but like
HH 207 this is incompatible with their known high radial velocities. The de cit in [O III]
is similar to that seen in the Orion proplyds (O'Dell & Wen 1994) and indicates that the
dust concentration in the shock is strong enough to block out the background nebular

{ 19 {
emission. The bright knot of HH 208 is surrounded by a fainter, almost spherical shell
which is elongated to the SE. HH 209 shows three bright knots imbedded in a circular disk
of emission and does not resemble any expected shock structures. The faint star 200 to the
north of HH 208 has a weak extension in H along a direction away from HH 208. Whether
or not this feature might represent a jet from the star whose opposite lobe produces
HH 208 can be tested with proper motion observations of HH 208 or with radial velocity
measurements of the H feature.

5. Discussion
There appear to be at least two types of HH objects in the Orion Nebula region.
HH 205-6-7, 210, and 201 have high spatial velocities, quasi-symmetric forms and small
sizes. These are probably shocks in the dense PDR region, where the cooling lengths would
be correspondingly short and the objects smaller. These objects all have a common region
of origin, although it is unlikely to be a single point of origin. It is interesting that if one
accepts large errors in the proper motion directions and ts HH 201, 205, 206, and 210 to
a common center, there appears to be a common epoch of origin, which is about 900 years
ago (Hu 1996b). The second type of HH object includes HH 202 and HH 203-4, which
are much larger, have lower spatial velocities, and have extended [O III] emission. These
are probably shocks formed in the neutral lid overlying the Orion Nebula and have their
high ionization sustained by ux from 1 C Ori which enters the lid behind the shock. The
extinction of the background nebular emission in [O III] by HH 208 and HH 209 would
require them to be ahead of the main ionization front, and therefore would be associated
with the lid, so that they represent characteristics of both the North and South systems.
HH 208 may be associated with a jet from 154-240 or from the star just to its north,
while HH 209 lacks any symmetry, apparant jets, or proper motions, hence is impossible to

{ 20 {
identify with a candidate source. HH 269 is possibly the archtype of a third class of HH
object in Orion, being a knotted oval in form, in line with at least one similar object, and
possessing extended [O III] emission, again arguing that it arises in the lid.

5.1. The H2 Finger System
The mechanism driving the ngers that are seen best in H2 have been discussed by
the discoverers (Allen & Burton 1993), Stone et al. (1995), Schild et al. (1996), and
McCaughrean & Mac Low (1996). None of these papers seem to consider the elongated
clumped ow recently seen in the same area in NH3 (Wiseman & Ho 1996) which provides
evidence that massive clumps of material exist within OMC-1. These clumps raise the
possibility that the ngers exist simply because they are the regions where wind driven
material nds it easiest to penetrate, an idea recently pursued by Gvaramadze (1997).
The operation of such a mechanism may be supported by the fact that the PhD thesis of
Tedds (1996) argues that the extinction along the ngers is relatively constant but is higher
between them.
The inner part of IRc2 region shows enormous detail in the H2 images, suggesting that
all structures, including the ngers, have their origin in this inner region rather than by
shaping of a more general stellar wind. Recent infrared Fabry-Perot images at 14 km s?1
FWHM resolution (Chrysostomou et al. 1997) detect a 5 km s?1 di erence in velocities
along a NW-SE line, which indicates a tilted bipolar ow. They even see pro les showing
line splitting in localised regions in the central 30" around BN, with features moving at both
red- and blue-shifted velocities with respect to OMC{1. They argue that these represent
bow-shocks seen in just the H2 lines, and are produced by the same mechanism giving rise
to the ngers, the latter being where the ambient cloud density is less.

{ 21 {
The fact that essentially all of the infrared ngers that fall within the region searched
with HST in [O I] and [S II] have optical counterparts argues that they all penetrate to
at least near the observer's side of OMC-1, which would not be the case for any of the
mechanisms having them shaped in the central region. The instability mechanism proposed
by Stone et al. (1995) can also occur if a stellar wind driven shock reaches a zone of rapid
density decrease. Since this would selectively produce objects near the surface, such a
mechanism becomes attractive, but requires that the density gradient be encountered deep
within OMC-1.
The good correlation of the [O I] and [S II] visual images with the infrared [Fe II]
images indicates the tips uniformly su er little extra extinction. This is contradicted by the
results of Chrysostomou et al. 1997 who argue that the visual extinctions of HH 201, 203,
207,and 210 range from 4.5?8.7 magnitudes, as determined by two infrared [Fe II] lines
arising from the same upper level. These extinction values are about ve times the average
for M42 and don't show up in the point by point mapping of M42 extinction (O'Dell et al.
1992). Certainly HH 201, 207, and 210 must be shielded from photoionization by 1 C Ori
but it takes relatively little corresponding visual extinction to produce this. In the case
of HH 203, where the [Fe II] extinction is like the others, the extinction could only be
produced in the compression immediately in front of the shock and there is little reason for
expecting it to be similar to the values for the other three, which are formed in OMC-1.
Reconciliation of these results could arise from small di erences in the calibration of the
infrared system and/or the projection from a small frequency di erence into the visual.
If one accepts that the HH objects of the North System are on the surface of OMC-1
then the fact that they are traceable back towards the center means that whatever is
producing the H2 ngers is also preferentially working on the observer's side of OMC-1.
This could be explained by arguing that the most obvious energy source, IRc2, is located in

{ 22 {
a region relatively near the surface, so that there is a strong preferential density gradient,
which allows ow of wind driven material towards the observer. The most likely mechanism
for shaping this ow is large scale mass concentrations. Such a scenario seems much more
likely than the existence of a host of bullets passing through OMC-1, reaching the surface
at the same time, and all having su ered little or similar amounts of deceleration.
As an aside we point out that if the driving mechanism involves a global transfer of
momentum, rather than a local source such as a jet, then the ngers and tips in the North
System should not be classi ed as HH objects. The commonality of appearance would
indicate the shared importance of shock excitation, but would not associate the North
System objects with lower mass pre-main sequence stars with jets, which seems to be the
common factor in true HH objects. Uncollimated ejection would still arise from accretion
by a pre-main sequence star, which would give the ngers a driving source similar to the
jets producing the "classical" HH objects.
The highest excitation optical lines occur at the tips of the H2 ngers, as expected in
a bow shock model. However, in addition, any model of the ngers will have to reconcile
the high radial velocities and large proper motions with the relatively low excitation line
emission observed. In a standard bow shock model, the low excitation and high velocities
can be explained if either the gas ahead of the ngers moves outward at several hundred
km s?1 with respect to IRc2 or if the magnetic elds there are enormous (milligauss
strengths). It will be important to predict how the shock velocity should vary along
arcs formed by a fragmenting stellar wind, so that this prediction can be compared with
observations. If previous jets and winds have indeed punched several holes through OMC-1
and we are observing the result of a stellar wind shell as it funnels along these tubes, it
makes sense that the shock velocity should be highest at the apex, where the velocity jump
should be the largest. This model also predicts that the space velocities of the ngers will

{ 23 {
be much higher than their shock velocities, as is observed to be the case.

5.2. Possible Jet Related Features
If the other objects discussed are true HH objects, why (with the possible exception of
HH 208) do we not see the driving jet? Part of the problem throughout the nebula is that
the bright background photoionization sometimes makes it dicult to observe any faint
line emission from weak shocks in a ow. In the case of the South System HH objects the
lack of a visible jet may lie in the fact that the jets are passing through a medium that has
been highly photoionized, so that the usual low ionization tracers are not available. This
conclusion is strengthened by the observations of Hu (1996a) that show an apparent high
velocity [O III] jet leading into HH 203, a conclusion con rmed and extended in HMO.
In the case of the southern object HH 269, we can envision a scenario that would
describe both its form and also its similar companion feature to the east. The 21 cm
absorption study of HI in the lid (van der Werf & Goss 1989) not only established the
presence of the lid, but also showed that it was highly irregular and was grouped into three
velocity systems. The form of HH 269 and the similar object to its east could be due to a
single jet having passed completely through two clouds within the lid, leaving behind two
rings of shocked material.
Finally, we must address the problem of why all of the HH objects in this region show
only blue shifted lines with respect to OMC-1. We have explained this as one set of objects
arising in the portion of the PDR of OMC-1 that faces the observer and the other set arising
from the foreground lid. The second set of objects presumably have sources that exist in
the open cavity near the Trapezium stars, which means that their bipolar jets would have
corresponding antipodal features. Since these jets would be impacting the main ionization

{ 24 {
front behind the Trapezium, which is both of much higher density and ionization than the
regions giving rise to the blue shifted HH objects, it is likely that they will very di erent
ionizations, much smaller sizes, and possibly lower relative velocities than the observed
objects. A search for such objects is being pursued in HMO.

5.3. Concluding Remarks and Acknowledgements
Since objects HH 201 and HH 203+204 both appear in the higher resolution CCD of
WFPC2, it is hoped that very accurate proper motions of these objects can be obtained
with a second set of similar observations. This expectation is based on the fact that the
study of Jones & Walker (1985) and Hu (1996b) indicate that HH 201 is moving about
0.0800/yr and Cudworth & Stone (1977) determine that HH 204 is moving about 0.0300/yr.
The highest resolution WFPC2 pixels are 0.04600, so that good proper motions should be
feasible in only a few years.
Although we have used the standard catalog listing for the known HH objects in
this paper, e.g. HH 201, this study shows that there are so many shocked features
that it is probably wise to begin use of an Orion speci c coordinate based system of
designation for the secondary and new systems. The details of such a system are described
in O'Dell & Wen (1994). Digital copies of the monochromatic images shifted into the
composite, north oriented format are available through the senior author by ftp transfer

Fig. 1.| This color coded image was formed by the use of A&B's H2 as red, the HST [S II]+
[O I] images as green, and H as blue. The red "halo" around the stars is due to the lower
angular resolution of the groundbased images of A&B. We have labeled the location of the
previously known HH objects, the BN source, and the numbered IRc radio and infrared
sources. The long straight arrows indicate the proper motion of the measured HH objects
over the last 400 years. The curved lines outline HH 202, a few new HH objects, and the
border of the infrared ngers determined by a detailed examination on a good video screen.
North is at the top and East is to the left.
Fig. 2.| The central region imaged as the north eld by HST is shown as a combination
of the [S II] and [O I] images. The left image is without labeling and the right uses labels
similar to Fig.1. The arrow indicates the proper motion of HH 201 over the last 200 years.
The middle thin straight line is along a long linear feature that points towards star 130-201,
although this feature is probably a portion of the ionization front viewed edge on. The lower
straight line is drawn through HH 208 and the symmetric grouping of shocks NW of it. It
falls along a long linear feature extending past 147-234 and directly towards the proplyd
154-240. This may be the jet that is driving HH 208.
