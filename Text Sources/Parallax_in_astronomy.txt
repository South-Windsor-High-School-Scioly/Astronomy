Parallax in astronomy
The most important fundamental distance measurements in
astronomy come from trigonometric parallax, as applied in the
stellar parallax method. As the Earth orbits the Sun, the position
of nearby stars will appear to shift slightly against the more distant
background. These shifts are angles in an isosceles triangle, with 2
AU (the distance between the extreme positions of Earth's orbit
around the Sun) making the base leg of the triangle and the
distance to the star being the long equal-length legs. The amount
of shift is quite small, even for the nearest stars, measuring 1 Stellar parallax motion from annual

increases. Astronomers usually express distances in units of
parsecs (parallax arcseconds); light-years are used in
popular media.

Because parallax becomes smaller for a greater stellar
distance, useful distances can be measured only for stars
which are near enough to have a parallax larger than a few
times the precision of the measurement. In the 1990s, for
example, the Hipparcos mission obtained parallaxes for over
a hundred thousand stars with a precision of about a
milliarcsecond,[1] providing useful distances for stars out to
a few hundred parsecs. The Hubble Space Telescope's Wide
Field Camera 3 has the potential to provide a precision of 20
to 40 microarcseconds, enabling reliable distance Parallax is an angle subtended by a line on

Center, about 30,000 light years away. Stars have a velocity
relative to the Sun that causes proper motion (transverse
across the sky) and radial velocity (motion toward or away from the Sun). The former is determined by
plotting the changing position of the stars over many years, while the latter comes from measuring the
Doppler shift of the star's spectrum caused by motion along the line of sight. For a group of stars with the
same spectral class and a similar magnitude range, a mean parallax can be derived from statistical
analysis of the proper motions relative to their radial velocities. This statistical parallax method is useful
for measuring the distances of bright stars beyond 50 parsecs and giant variable stars, including Cepheids
and the RR Lyrae variables.[5]



The motion of the Sun through space provides a
longer baseline that will increase the accuracy of
parallax measurements, known as secular
parallax. For stars in the Milky Way disk, this
corresponds to a mean baseline of 4 AU per year,
while for halo stars the baseline is 40 AU per
year. After several decades, the baseline can be
orders of magnitude greater than the Earth–Sun
baseline used for traditional parallax. However,
secular parallax introduces a higher level of
uncertainty because the relative velocity of
observed stars is an additional unknown. When Parallax measurements may be an important clue to

inversely proportional to the square root of the
sample size.[8]

Moving cluster parallax is a technique where the motions of
individual stars in a nearby star cluster can be used to find the
distance to the cluster. Only open clusters are near enough for this
technique to be useful. In particular the distance obtained for the
Hyades has historically been an important step in the distance
ladder.

Other individual objects can have fundamental distance estimates
made for them under special circumstances. If the expansion of a
gas cloud, like a supernova remnant or planetary nebula, can be
observed over time, then an expansion parallax distance to that
cloud can be estimated. Those measurements however suffer from
uncertainties in the deviation of the object from sphericity. Binary

to these methods is that a measurement of angular motion is
combined with a measurement of the absolute velocity (usually
obtained via the Doppler effect). The distance estimate comes from computing how far the object must be
to make its observed absolute velocity appear with the observed angular motion.

Expansion parallaxes in particular can give fundamental distance estimates for objects that are very far,
because supernova ejecta have large expansion velocities and large sizes (compared to stars). Further,
they can be observed with radio interferometers which can measure very small angular motions. These



combine to provide fundamental distance estimates to supernovae in other galaxies.[9] Though valuable,
such cases are quite rare, so they serve as important consistency checks on the distance ladder rather than
workhorse steps by themselves.

Parsec
The parsec (symbol: pc) is a unit of length used to measure the
large distances to astronomical objects outside the Solar System,
approximately equal to 3.26 light-years or 206,265 astronomical
units (AU), i.e. 30.9 trillion kilometres (19.2 trillion miles).[a] The
parsec unit is obtained by the use of parallax and trigonometry,
and is defined as the distance at which 1 AU subtends an angle of
one arcsecond[10] ( 1

3600  of a degree). The nearest star, Proxima
Centauri, is about 1.3 parsecs (4.2 light-years) from the Sun: from
that distance, the gap between the Earth and the Sun spans slightly
less than  1

3600  of one degree of view.[11] Most stars visible to the
naked eye are within a few hundred parsecs of the Sun, with the
most distant at a few thousand parsecs, and the Andromeda
Galaxy at over 700,000 parsecs.[12]

The word parsec is a portmanteau of "parallax of one second" and
was coined by the British astronomer Herbert Hall Turner in
1913[13] to simplify astronomers' calculations of astronomical A parsec is the distance from the
distances from only raw observational data. Partly for this reason, Sun to an astronomical object that
it is the unit preferred in astronomy and astrophysics, though the has a parallax angle of one
light-year remains prominent in popular science texts and common arcsecond (not to scale)

usage. Although parsecs are used for the shorter distances within
the Milky Way, multiples of parsecs are required for the larger scales in the universe, including
kiloparsecs (kpc) for the more distant objects within and around the Milky Way, megaparsecs (Mpc) for
mid-distance galaxies, and gigaparsecs (Gpc) for many quasars and the most distant galaxies.

In August 2015, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) passed Resolution B2 which, as part of the
definition of a standardized absolute and apparent bolometric magnitude scale, mentioned an existing

648 000
explicit definition of the parsec as exactly  π  au, or approximately
3.085 677 581 491 3673 × 1016 metres (based on the IAU 2012 definition of the astronomical unit). This
corresponds to the small-angle definition of the parsec found in many astronomical references.[14][15]

Stellar parallax
Stellar parallax created by the relative motion between the Earth and a star can be seen, in the Copernican
model, as arising from the orbit of the Earth around the Sun: the star only appears to move relative to
more distant objects in the sky. In a geostatic model, the movement of the star would have to be taken as
real with the star oscillating across the sky with respect to the background stars.



Stellar parallax is most often measured using annual parallax, defined as
the difference in position of a star as seen from the Earth and Sun, i.e. the
angle subtended at a star by the mean radius of the Earth's orbit around the
Sun. The parsec (3.26 light-years) is defined as the distance for which the
annual parallax is 1 arcsecond. Annual parallax is normally measured by
observing the position of a star at different times of the year as the Earth
moves through its orbit. Measurement of annual parallax was the first
reliable way to determine the distances to the closest stars. The first
successful measurements of stellar parallax were made by Friedrich
Bessel in 1838 for the star 61 Cygni using a heliometer.[16] Stellar parallax
remains the standard for calibrating other measurement methods. Accurate
calculations of distance based on stellar parallax require a measurement of
the distance from the Earth to the Sun, now based on radar reflection off
the surfaces of planets.[17]

The angles involved in these calculations are very small and thus difficult
to measure. The nearest star to the Sun (and thus the star with the largest
parallax), Proxima Centauri, has a parallax of 0.7687 ± 0.0003 arcsec.[18] Stellar parallax motion
This angle is approximately that subtended by an object 2 centimeters in
diameter located 5.3 kilometers away.

The fact that stellar parallax was so small that it was
unobservable at the time was used as the main scientific
argument against heliocentrism during the early modern
age. It is clear from Euclid's geometry that the effect would
be undetectable if the stars were far enough away, but for
various reasons such gigantic distances involved seemed
entirely implausible: it was one of Tycho's principal
objections to Copernican heliocentrism that for it to be
compatible with the lack of observable stellar parallax, there

to 10,000 light-years away (10 April the orbit of Saturn (then the most distant known planet) and
2014).[19] the eighth sphere (the fixed stars).[20]

In 1989, the satellite Hipparcos was launched primarily for
obtaining improved parallaxes and proper motions for over 100,000 nearby stars, increasing the reach of
the method tenfold. Even so, Hipparcos was only able to measure parallax angles for stars up to about
1,600 light-years away, a little more than one percent of the diameter of the Milky Way Galaxy. The
European Space Agency's Gaia mission, launched in December 2013, can measure parallax angles to an
accuracy of 10 microarcseconds, thus mapping nearby stars (and potentially planets) up to a distance of
tens of thousands of light-years from Earth.[21][22] In April 2014, NASA astronomers reported that the
Hubble Space Telescope, by using spatial scanning, can precisely measure distances up to 10,000 light-
years away, a ten-fold improvement over earlier measurements.[19]

Diurnal parallax



Diurnal parallax is a parallax that varies with the rotation of the Earth or with a difference in location on
the Earth. The Moon and to a smaller extent the terrestrial planets or asteroids seen from different
viewing positions on the Earth (at one given moment) can appear differently placed against the
background of fixed stars.[23][24]

The diurnal parallax has been used by John Flamsteed in 1672 to measure the distance to Mars at its
opposition and through that to estimate the astronomical unit and the size of the Solar System.[25]

Lunar parallax
Lunar parallax (often short for lunar horizontal parallax or lunar equatorial horizontal parallax), is a
special case of (diurnal) parallax: the Moon, being the nearest celestial body, has by far the largest
maximum parallax of any celestial body, at times exceeding 1 degree.[26]

The diagram for stellar parallax can illustrate lunar parallax as well if the diagram is taken to be scaled
right down and slightly modified. Instead of 'near star', read 'Moon', and instead of taking the circle at the
bottom of the diagram to represent the size of the Earth's orbit around the Sun, take it to be the size of the
Earth's globe, and a circle around the Earth's surface. Then, the lunar (horizontal) parallax amounts to the
difference in angular position, relative to the background of distant stars, of the Moon as seen from two
different viewing positions on the Earth.

One of the viewing positions is the place from which the Moon can be seen directly overhead at a given
moment. That is, viewed along the vertical line in the diagram. The other viewing position is a place from
which the Moon can be seen on the horizon at the same moment. That is, viewed along one of the
diagonal lines, from an Earth-surface position corresponding roughly to one of the blue dots on the
modified diagram.

The lunar (horizontal) parallax can alternatively be defined as the angle subtended at the distance of the
Moon by the radius of the Earth[27][28]—equal to angle p in the diagram when scaled-down and modified
as mentioned above.

The lunar horizontal parallax at any time depends on the linear distance of the Moon from the Earth. The
Earth-Moon linear distance varies continuously as the Moon follows its perturbed and approximately
elliptical orbit around the Earth. The range of the variation in linear distance is from about 56 to 63.7
Earth radii, corresponding to a horizontal parallax of about a degree of arc, but ranging from about 61.4'
to about 54'.[26] The Astronomical Almanac and similar publications tabulate the lunar horizontal parallax
and/or the linear distance of the Moon from the Earth on a periodical e.g. daily basis for the convenience
of astronomers (and of celestial navigators), and the study of how this coordinate varies with time forms
part of lunar theory.

Parallax can also be used to determine the distance to the Moon.

One way to determine the lunar parallax from one location is by using a lunar eclipse. A full shadow of
the Earth on the Moon has an apparent radius of curvature equal to the difference between the apparent
radii of the Earth and the Sun as seen from the Moon. This radius can be seen to be equal to 0.75 degrees,
from which (with the solar apparent radius of 0.25 degrees) we get an Earth apparent radius of 1 degree.



This yields for the Earth-Moon distance 60.27 Earth
radii or 384,399 kilometres (238,854 mi) This
procedure was first used by Aristarchus of Samos[29]

and Hipparchus, and later found its way into the work
of Ptolemy.[30]

The diagram at the right shows how daily lunar parallax
arises on the geocentric and geostatic planetary model,
in which the Earth is at the center of the planetary
system and does not rotate. It also illustrates the
important point that parallax need not be caused by any
motion of the observer, contrary to some definitions of
parallax that say it is, but may arise purely from motion
of the observed.

Another method is to take two pictures of the Moon at
the same time from two locations on Earth and compare
the positions of the Moon relative to the stars. Using
the orientation of the Earth, those two position Diagram of daily lunar parallax

measurements, and the distance between the two
locations on the Earth, the distance to the Moon can be triangulated:

This is the method referred to by Jules Verne in his 1865 novel
From the Earth to the Moon:

Until then, many people had no idea how one could
calculate the distance separating the Moon from the
Earth. The circumstance was exploited to teach them
that this distance was obtained by measuring the
parallax of the Moon. If the word parallax appeared to
amaze them, they were told that it was the angle
subtended by two straight lines running from both
ends of the Earth's radius to the Moon. If they had Example of lunar parallax:
doubts about the perfection of this method, they were Occultation of Pleiades by the Moon
immediately shown that not only did this mean
distance amount to a whole two hundred thirty-four
thousand three hundred and forty-seven miles (94,330
leagues) but also that the astronomers were not in
error by more than seventy miles (≈ 30 leagues).

Solar parallax



After Copernicus proposed his heliocentric system, with the Earth in revolution around the Sun, it was
possible to build a model of the whole Solar System without scale. To ascertain the scale, it is necessary
only to measure one distance within the Solar System, e.g., the mean distance from the Earth to the Sun
(now called an astronomical unit, or AU). When found by triangulation, this is referred to as the solar
parallax, the difference in position of the Sun as seen from the Earth's center and a point one Earth radius
away, i.e., the angle subtended at the Sun by the Earth's mean radius. Knowing the solar parallax and the
mean Earth radius allows one to calculate the AU, the first, small step on the long road of establishing the
size and expansion age[31] of the visible Universe.

A primitive way to determine the distance to the Sun in terms of the distance to the Moon was already
proposed by Aristarchus of Samos in his book On the Sizes and Distances of the Sun and Moon. He noted
that the Sun, Moon, and Earth form a right triangle (with the right angle at the Moon) at the moment of
first or last quarter moon. He then estimated that the Moon–Earth–Sun angle was 87°. Using correct
geometry but inaccurate observational data, Aristarchus concluded that the Sun was slightly less than 20
times farther away than the Moon. The true value of this angle is close to 89° 50', and the Sun is about
390 times farther away.[29]

Aristarchus pointed out that the Moon and Sun have nearly equal apparent angular sizes, and therefore
their diameters must be in proportion to their distances from Earth. He thus concluded that the Sun was
around 20 times larger than the Moon. This conclusion, although incorrect, follows logically from his
incorrect data. It suggests that the Sun is larger than the Earth, which could be taken to support the
heliocentric model.[32]

Although Aristarchus' results were incorrect due
to observational errors, they were based on
correct geometric principles of parallax, and
became the basis for estimates of the size of the
Solar System for almost 2000 years, until the
transit of Venus was correctly observed in 1761
and 1769.[29] This method was proposed by
Edmond Halley in 1716, although he did not live
to see the results. The use of Venus transits was
less successful than had been hoped due to the Measuring Venus transit times to determine solar

black drop effect, but the resulting estimate, 153 parallax

million kilometers, is just 2% above the currently
accepted value, 149.6 million kilometers.

Much later, the Solar System was "scaled" using the parallax of asteroids, some of which, such as Eros,
pass much closer to Earth than Venus. In a favorable opposition, Eros can approach the Earth to within
22 million kilometers.[33] During the opposition of 1900–1901, a worldwide program was launched to
make parallax measurements of Eros to determine the solar parallax[34] (or distance to the Sun), with the
results published in 1910 by Arthur Hinks of Cambridge[35] and Charles D. Perrine of the Lick
Observatory, University of California.[36]

Perrine published progress reports in 1906[37] and 1908.[38] He took 965 photographs with the Crossley
Reflector and selected 525 for measurement.[39] A similar program was then carried out, during a closer
approach, in 1930–1931 by Harold Spencer Jones.[40] The value of the Astronomical Unit (roughly the



Earth-Sun distance) obtained by this program was considered definitive until 1968, when radar and
dynamical parallax methods started producing more precise measurements.

Also radar reflections, both off Venus (1958) and off asteroids, like Icarus, have been used for solar
parallax determination. Today, use of spacecraft telemetry links has solved this old problem. The
currently accepted value of solar parallax is 8.794 143 arcseconds.[41]

Moving-cluster parallax
The open stellar cluster Hyades in Taurus extends over such a large part of the sky, 20 degrees, that the
proper motions as derived from astrometry appear to converge with some precision to a perspective point
north of Orion. Combining the observed apparent (angular) proper motion in seconds of arc with the also
observed true (absolute) receding motion as witnessed by the Doppler redshift of the stellar spectral lines,
allows estimation of the distance to the cluster (151 light-years) and its member stars in much the same
way as using annual parallax.[42]

Dynamical parallax
Dynamical parallax has sometimes also been used to determine the distance to a supernova when the
optical wavefront of the outburst is seen to propagate through the surrounding dust clouds at an apparent
angular velocity, while its true propagation velocity is known to be the speed of light.[43]

Spatio-temporal parallax
From enhanced relativistic positioning systems, spatio-temporal parallax generalizing the usual notion
of parallax in space only has been developed. Then, event fields in spacetime can be deduced directly
without intermediate models of light bending by massive bodies such as the one used in the PPN
formalism for instance.[44]

Statistical parallax
Two related techniques can determine the mean distances of stars by modelling the motions of stars. Both
are referred to as statistical parallaxes, or individually called secular parallaxes and classical statistical
parallaxes.

The motion of the Sun through space provides a longer baseline that will increase the accuracy of
parallax measurements, known as secular parallax. For stars in the Milky Way disk, this corresponds to
a mean baseline of 4 AU per year. For halo stars the baseline is 40 AU per year. After several decades, the
baseline can be orders of magnitude greater than the Earth–Sun baseline used for traditional parallax.
Secular parallax introduces a higher level of uncertainty, because the relative velocity of other stars is an
additional unknown. When applied to samples of multiple stars, the uncertainty can be reduced; the
precision is inversely proportional to the square root of the sample size.[8]



The mean parallaxes and distances of a large group of stars can be estimated from their radial velocities
and proper motions. This is known as a classical statistical parallax. The motions of the stars are
modelled to statistically reproduce the velocity dispersion based on their distance.[8][45]

Other methods for distance measurement in astronomy
In astronomy, the term "parallax" has come to mean a method of estimating distances, not necessarily
utilizing a true parallax, such as:

Photometric parallax method
Spectroscopic parallax
