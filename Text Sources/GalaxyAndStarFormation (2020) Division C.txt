2020 Rules [DRAFT]
1. DESCRIPTION: Teams will demonstrate an understanding of Star and Galaxy 
Formation and Evolution

A TEAM OF UP TO: 2 APPROXIMATE TIME: 50 minutes

2. EVENT PARAMETERS: Each team may bring one of the following options 
containing information in any form and from any source:

i. a computer/tablet and a three-ring binder; or, 
ii. two computers/tablets, of any kind.

4



2020 Rules [DRAFT]
b. If three ring binders are used they may be of any size and the information 
contained should be attached using the available rings. The information or 
pages may be removed during the event. Sheet protectors and laminated 
sheets are allowed.

c. Each team may bring two calculators of any type (stand alone or computer 
app)

d. Participants using computers/tablets as a resource should have all 
information stored so that it is available to them offline. However; teams may 
be accessing a dedicated NASA image analysis website to answer JS9 questions. 
For JS9 questions, supervisors must provide an alternative (e.g. proctor-
supplied computer or screen shots) for teams that did not bring a laptop/tablet.

from disk

quasar and us absorb x-rays

stack many observations

Type Ia Supernovae

• From white dwarf with mass > 1.4 solar 
masses (Chandrasekhar Limit)

• “Standard candle” for measuring distance 
because they are all the same brightness 
(well... maybe)
• Slow mass transfer from binary companion, 

mass = 1.4 solar masses
• Collision with another white dwarf, mass = ???

AGNs & Quasars

• Bright across many wavelengths, 
often variable

• Unified Model – all AGNs/quasars 
are similar, just viewed from 
different angles
• Disk of matter accreting onto a 

supermassive black hole
• Sometimes (but not always) 

produces a narrow jet

27



Dark Matter

• Several times more mass than 
“normal” matter

• Galactic orbital velocities should 
follow Kepler’s Law
• Instead, rotation curves are flat

• Gravitational lensing
• Mass bends light paths
• Strong lensing (multiple images or arcs) 

vs. weak lensing (shape distortion)

Cosmic Microwave Background

• Era of Recombination
• When universe was ionized, photons 

couldn’t travel far without interacting 
with matter

• Recombination of electrons + nuclei –
no longer ionized, photons go free

• Almost perfect blackbody
• Temperature at recombination, 

redshifted by expansion of the universe
• Primordial fluctuations
