2020 Rules [DRAFT]
1. DESCRIPTION: Teams will demonstrate an understanding of Star and Galaxy
Formation and Evolution
A TEAM OF UP TO: 2

APPROXIMATE TIME: 50 minutes

2. EVENT PARAMETERS: Each team may bring one of the following options
containing information in any form and from any source:
i. a computer/tablet and a three-ring binder; or,
ii. two computers/tablets, of any kind.

2020 Rules [DRAFT]
b. If three ring binders are used they may be of any size and the information
contained should be attached using the available rings. The information or
pages may be removed during the event. Sheet protectors and laminated
sheets are allowed.
c. Each team may bring two calculators of any type (stand alone or computer
app)
d. Participants using computers/tablets as a resource should have all
information stored so that it is available to them offline. However; teams may
be accessing a dedicated NASA image analysis website to answer JS9 questions.
For JS9 questions, supervisors must provide an alternative (e.g. proctorsupplied computer or screen shots) for teams that did not bring a laptop/tablet.

2020 Rules [DRAFT]
3. THE COMPETITION: Using information which may include Hertzsprung-Russell
diagrams, spectra, light curves, motions, cosmological distance equations and
relationships, stellar magnitudes and classification, multi-wavelength images
(gamma-ray, X-ray, UV, optical, IR, radio), charts, graphs and JS9 imaging analysis
software, teams will complete activities and answer questions related to:
a. Stellar and galactic evolution including stellar classification, spectral features
and chemical composition, luminosity, blackbody radiation, color index and H-R
diagram transitions, neutron stars, stellar mass and supermassive black holes,
Type Ia supernovas, galactic structure and interactions, quasars, active galactic
nuclei (AGNs), galaxy clusters and groups of galaxies, gravitational waves,
gravitational lensing, dark matter and energy, warm hot intergalactic medium
(WHIM), and the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB).

2020 Rules [DRAFT]
b. Use Kepler‚Äôs laws, rotation and circular motion to answer questions relating
to the orbital motions of galaxies; use the distance modulus, Type Ia
supernovas, Hubble‚Äôs law and redshift to answer questions about Hubble‚Äôs
constant and the recessional velocities and distances to galaxies.
