Orion Nebula
The Orion Nebula (also known as Messier 42, M42, Orion Nebula
or NGC 1976) is a diffuse nebula situated in the
Milky Way, being south of Orion's Belt in the Diffuse nebula
constellation of Orion,[b] and is known as the middle
"star" in the "sword" of Orion. It is one of the
brightest nebulae and is visible to the naked eye in the
night sky with an apparent magnitude of 4.0. It is
1,344 ± 20 light-years (412.1 ± 6.1 pc) away[3][6] and
is the closest region of massive star formation to
Earth. The M42 nebula is estimated to be 24 light-
years across (so its apparent size from Earth is
approximately 1 degree). It has a mass of about 2,000
times that of the Sun. Older texts frequently refer to
the Orion Nebula as the Great Nebula in Orion or the
Great Orion Nebula.[7]

The Orion Nebula is one of the most scrutinized and
photographed objects in the night sky and is among

The Orion Nebula contains a very young open cluster, 281
known as the Trapezium Cluster due to the asterism
of its primary four stars within a diameter of 1.5 light
years. Two of these can be resolved into their
component binary systems on nights with good
seeing, giving a total of six stars. The stars of the
Trapezium Cluster, along with many other stars, are
still in their early years. The Trapezium Cluster is a
component of the much larger Orion Nebula cluster,
an association of about 2,800 stars within a diameter
of 20 light years.[10] The Orion Nebula is in turn 0:00
surrounded by the much larger Orion molecular cloud
complex which is hundreds of light years across,
spanning the whole Orion Constellation. Two million Discussing the location of the Orion Nebula, what

and Mu Columbae, which are currently moving away
from the nebula at speeds greater than 100 km/s (62 mi/s).[11]

Coloration
Observers have long noted a distinctive greenish tint to the nebula, in
addition to regions of red and of blue-violet. The red hue is a result of
the Hα recombination line radiation at a wavelength of 656.3 nm. The
blue-violet coloration is the reflected radiation from the massive O-
class stars at the core of the nebula.

The green hue was a puzzle for astronomers in the early part of the
20th century because none of the known spectral lines at that time
could explain it. There was some speculation that the lines were
caused by a new element, and the name nebulium was coined for this
mysterious material. With better understanding of atomic physics,
however, it was later determined that the green spectrum was caused
by a low-probability electron transition in doubly ionized oxygen, a
so-called "forbidden transition". This radiation was impossible to
reproduce in the laboratory at the time, because it depended on the
quiescent and nearly collision-free environment found in the high
vacuum of deep space.[12]

History the Orion Nebula (lower middle)

There has been speculation that the Mayans of Central America may
have described the nebula within their "Three Hearthstones" creation myth; if so, the three would
correspond to two stars at the base of Orion, Rigel and Saiph, and another, Alnitak at the tip of the "belt"
of the imagined hunter, the vertices of a nearly perfect equilateral triangle with Orion's Sword (including



the Orion Nebula) in the middle of the triangle seen as the smudge
of smoke from copal incense in a modern myth, or, in (the
translation it suggests of) an ancient one, the literal or figurative
embers of a fiery creation.[13][14]

Neither Ptolemy's Almagest nor al Sufi's Book of Fixed Stars
noted this nebula, even though they both listed patches of
nebulosity elsewhere in the night sky; nor did Galileo mention it,
even though he also made telescopic observations surrounding it
in 1610 and 1617.[15] This has led to some speculation that a flare-
up of the illuminating stars may have increased the brightness of

Messier's drawing of the Orion the nebula.[16]

Nebula in his 1771 memoir,
Mémoires de l'Académie Royale The first discovery of the diffuse nebulous nature of the Orion

Nebula is generally credited to French astronomer Nicolas-Claude
Fabri de Peiresc, on November 26, 1610, when he made a record

of observing it with a refracting telescope purchased by his patron Guillaume du Vair.[15]

The first published observation of the nebula was by the Jesuit mathematician and astronomer Johann
Baptist Cysat of Lucerne in his 1619 monograph on the comets (describing observations of the nebula
that may date back to 1611).[17] [18] He made comparisons between it and a bright comet seen in 1618
and described how the nebula appeared through his telescope as:

one sees how in like manner some stars are compressed into a very narrow space and how
round about and between the stars a white light like that of a white cloud is poured out.[19]

His description of the center stars as different from a comet's head in that they were a "rectangle" may
have been an early description of the Trapezium Cluster.[15][19][20] (The first detection of three of the four
stars of this cluster is credited to Galileo Galilei in a February 4, 1617.[21] [22])

The nebula was independently "discovered" (though visible to the naked eye) by several other prominent
astronomers in the following years, including by Giovanni Battista Hodierna (whose sketch was the first
published in De systemate orbis cometici, deque admirandis coeli characteribus).[23] In 1659, Dutch
scientist Christiaan Huygens published the first detailed drawing of the central region of the nebula in
Systema Saturnium.[24]

Charles Messier observed the nebula on March 4, 1769, and he also noted three of the stars in Trapezium.
Messier published the first edition of his catalog of deep sky objects in 1774 (completed in 1771).[25] As
the Orion Nebula was the 42nd object in his list, it became identified as M42.

In 1865 English amateur astronomer William Huggins used his visual spectroscopy method to examine
the nebula showing it, like other nebulae he had examined, was made up of "luminous gas".[26] On
September 30, 1880 Henry Draper used the new dry plate photographic process with an 11-inch (28 cm)
refracting telescope to make a 51-minute exposure of the Orion Nebula, the first instance of
astrophotography of a nebula in history. Another set of photographs of the nebula in 1883 saw a
breakthrough in astronomical photography when amateur astronomer Andrew Ainslie Common used the



dry plate process to record several images in exposures up to 60
minutes with a 36-inch (91 cm) reflecting telescope that he
constructed in the backyard of his home in Ealing, west London.
These images for the first time showed stars and nebula detail too
faint to be seen by the human eye.[27]

In 1902, Vogel and Eberhard discovered differing velocities within
the nebula, and by 1914 astronomers at Marseilles had used the
interferometer to detect rotation and irregular motions. Campbell and
Moore confirmed these results using the spectrograph, demonstrating Henry Draper's 1880 photograph
turbulence within the nebula.[28] of the Orion Nebula, the first

ever taken.
In 1931, Robert J. Trumpler noted that the fainter stars near the
Trapezium formed a cluster, and he was the first to name them the
Trapezium cluster. Based on their magnitudes and spectral types, he
derived a distance estimate of 1,800 light years. This was three times
farther than the commonly accepted distance estimate of the period
but was much closer to the modern value.[29]

In 1993, the Hubble Space Telescope first observed the Orion Nebula.
Since then, the nebula has been a frequent target for HST studies. The
images have been used to build a detailed model of the nebula in One of Andrew Ainslie
three dimensions. Protoplanetary disks have been observed around Common's 1883 photographs of
most of the newly formed stars in the nebula, and the destructive the Orion Nebula, the first to
effects of high levels of ultraviolet energy from the most massive show that a long exposure could
stars have been studied.[30] record new stars and nebulae

invisible to the human eye.
In 2005, the Advanced Camera for Surveys instrument of the Hubble
Space Telescope finished capturing the most detailed image of the
nebula yet taken. The image was taken through 104 orbits of the telescope, capturing over 3,000 stars
down to the 23rd magnitude, including infant brown dwarfs and possible brown dwarf binary stars.[31] A
year later, scientists working with the HST announced the first ever masses of a pair of eclipsing binary
brown dwarfs, 2MASS J05352184–0546085. The pair are located in the Orion Nebula and have
approximate masses of 0.054 M☉ and 0.034 M☉ respectively, with an orbital period of 9.8 days.
Surprisingly, the more massive of the two also turned out to be the less luminous.[32]

In October 2023, astronomers, based on observations of the Orion Nebula with the James Webb Space
Telescope, reported the discovery of pairs of rogue planets, similar in mass to the planet Jupiter, and
called JuMBOs (short for Jupiter Mass Binary Objects).[33]

Structure
The entirety of the Orion Nebula extends across a 1° region of the sky, and includes neutral clouds of gas
and dust, associations of stars, ionized volumes of gas, and reflection nebulae.



The Nebula is part of a much larger nebula
that is known as the Orion molecular cloud
complex. The Orion molecular cloud complex
extends throughout the constellation of Orion
and includes Barnard's Loop, the Horsehead
Nebula, M43, M78, and the Flame Nebula.
Stars are forming throughout the entire Cloud
Complex, but most of the young stars are
concentrated in dense clusters like the one
illuminating the Orion Nebula.[34] [35]

The current astronomical model for the nebula
consists of an ionized (H II) region, roughly
centered on Theta1 Orionis C, which lies on A starchart of the Orion Nebula.

temperature falls
dramatically near the edge

of the nebula.[38] The nebulous emission comes primarily from photoionized gas on the back surface of
the cavity.[39] The H II region is surrounded by an irregular, concave bay of more neutral, high-density
cloud, with clumps of neutral gas lying outside the bay area. This in turn lies on the perimeter of the
Orion Molecular Cloud. The gas in the molecular cloud displays a range of velocities and turbulence,
particularly around the core region. Relative movements are up to 10 km/s (22,000 mi/h), with local
variations of up to 50 km/s and possibly more.[38]

Observers have given names to various features in the Orion Nebula. The dark bay that extends from the
north into the bright region is known as "Sinus Magnus",[40] also called the "Fish's Mouth". The
illuminated regions to both sides are called the "Wings". Other features include "The Sword", "The
Thrust", and "The Sail".[41]

Star formation
The Orion Nebula is an example of a stellar nursery where new stars are being born. Observations of the
nebula have revealed approximately 700 stars in various stages of formation within the nebula.



In 1979 observations with the Lallemand electronic camera at the
Pic-du-Midi Observatory showed six unresolved high-ionization
sources near the Trapezium Cluster. These sources were
interpreted as partly ionized globules (PIGs). The idea was that
these objects are being ionized from the outside by M42.[42] Later
observations with the Very Large Array showed solar-system-sized
condensations associated with these sources. Here the idea
appeared that these objects might be low-mass stars surrounded by
an evaporating protostellar accretion disk.[43] In 1993 observations View of several proplyds within the
with the Hubble Space Telescope have yielded the major Orion Nebula taken by the Hubble
confirmation of protoplanetary disks within the Orion Nebula, Space Telescope
which have been dubbed proplyds.[44][45] HST has revealed more
than 150 of these within the nebula, and they are considered to be
systems in the earliest stages of solar system formation. The sheer
numbers of them have been used as evidence that the formation of
planetary systems is fairly common in the universe.

Stars form when clumps of hydrogen and other gases in an H II
region contract under their own gravity. As the gas collapses, the
central clump grows stronger and the gas heats to extreme
temperatures by converting gravitational potential energy to
thermal energy. If the temperature gets high enough, nuclear
fusion will ignite and form a protostar. The protostar is 'born' when
it begins to emit enough radiative energy to balance out its gravity Star Formation Fireworks in Orion
and halt gravitational collapse.

Typically, a cloud of material remains a substantial distance from the star before the fusion reaction
ignites. This remnant cloud is the protostar's protoplanetary disk, where planets may form. Recent
infrared observations show that dust grains in these protoplanetary disks are growing, beginning on the
path towards forming planetesimals.[46]

Once the protostar enters into its main sequence phase, it is classified as a star. Even though most
planetary disks can form planets, observations show that intense stellar radiation should have destroyed
any proplyds that formed near the Trapezium group, if the group is as old as the low mass stars in the
cluster.[30] Since proplyds are found very close to the Trapezium group, it can be argued that those stars
are much younger than the rest of the cluster members.[c]

Stellar wind and effects
Once formed, the stars within the nebula emit a stream of charged particles known as a stellar wind.
Massive stars and young stars have much stronger stellar winds than the Sun.[47] The wind forms shock
waves or hydrodynamical instabilities when it encounters the gas in the nebula, which then shapes the gas
clouds. The shock waves from stellar wind also play a large part in stellar formation by compacting the
gas clouds, creating density inhomogeneities that lead to gravitational collapse of the cloud.

There are three different kinds of shocks in the Orion Nebula. Many are featured in Herbig–Haro
objects:[48]



Bow shocks are stationary and are formed when two
particle streams collide with each other. They are
present near the hottest stars in the nebula where the
stellar wind speed is estimated to be thousands of
kilometers per second and in the outer parts of the
nebula where the speeds are tens of kilometers per
second. Bow shocks can also form at the front end of
stellar jets when the jet hits interstellar particles. View of the ripples (Kelvin–
Jet-driven shocks are formed from jets of material Helmholtz instability) formed by the
sprouting off newborn T Tauri stars. These narrow action of stellar winds on the cloud.
streams are traveling at hundreds of kilometers per
second, and become shocks when they encounter
relatively stationary gases.
Warped shocks appear bow-like to an observer. They are produced when a jet-driven shock
encounters gas moving in a cross-current.
The interaction of the stellar wind with the surrounding cloud also forms "waves" which are
believed to be due to the hydrodynamical Kelvin-Helmholtz instability.[49]

The dynamic gas motions in M42 are complex, but are trending out through the opening in the bay and
toward the Earth.[38] The large neutral area behind the ionized region is currently contracting under its
own gravity.

There are also supersonic "bullets" of gas piercing the hydrogen clouds of the Orion Nebula. Each bullet
is ten times the diameter of Pluto's orbit and tipped with iron atoms glowing in the infrared. They were
probably formed one thousand years earlier from an unknown violent event.[50]

Evolution
Interstellar clouds like the Orion Nebula are found throughout
galaxies such as the Milky Way. They begin as gravitationally
bound blobs of cold, neutral hydrogen, intermixed with traces of
other elements. The cloud can contain hundreds of thousands of
solar masses and extend for hundreds of light years. The tiny force
of gravity that could compel the cloud to collapse is
counterbalanced by the very faint pressure of the gas in the cloud.

Whether due to collisions with a spiral arm, or through the shock
wave emitted from supernovae, the atoms are precipitated into
heavier molecules and the result is a molecular cloud. This
presages the formation of stars within the cloud, usually thought to
be within a period of 10–30 million years, as regions pass the Panoramic image of the center of
Jeans mass and the destabilized volumes collapse into disks. The the nebula, taken by the Hubble

evolution of the nebula, with additional stars still forming from the
collapsing molecular cloud. The youngest and brightest stars we
now see in the Orion Nebula are thought to be less than 300,000 years old,[51] and the brightest may be
only 10,000 years in age. Some of these collapsing stars can be particularly massive, and can emit large
quantities of ionizing ultraviolet radiation. An example of this is seen with the Trapezium cluster. Over



time the ultraviolet light from the massive stars at the center of the nebula will push away the surrounding
gas and dust in a process called photo evaporation. This process is responsible for creating the interior
cavity of the nebula, allowing the stars at the core to be viewed from Earth.[8] The largest of these stars
have short life spans and will evolve to become supernovae.

Within about 100,000 years, most of the gas and dust will be ejected. The remains will form a young open
cluster, a cluster of bright, young stars surrounded by wispy filaments from the former cloud.[52]
