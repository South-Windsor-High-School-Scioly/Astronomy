WASP-17b
WASP-17b, officially named Ditsö,̀ is an exoplanet in WASP-17b / Ditsö̀
the constellation Scorpius that is orbiting the star
WASP-17. Its discovery was announced on 11 August
2009.[1] It is the first planet discovered to have a
retrograde orbit, meaning it orbits in a direction
counter to the rotation of its host star.[1] This discovery
challenged traditional planetary formation theory.[4] In
terms of diameter, WASP-17b is one of the largest
exoplanets discovered and at half Jupiter's mass, this Size comparison of
made it the most puffy planet known in 2010.[5] On 3 Jupiter with Ditsö̀

Space Telescope reported detecting water in the
exoplanet's atmosphere.[6][7] Discovered by David R. Anderson et al

reveal the planet's size. The discovery was made with a Physical characteristics[2]

Observatory. Due to the involvement of the Wide Mean radius 1.991 ± 0.081 RJ

Astronomers at the Observatory of Geneva were then
able to use characteristic redshifts and blueshifts in the
host star's spectrum as its radial velocity varied over the course of the planet's orbit to measure the



planet's mass and obtain an indication of its orbital eccentricity.[1] Careful examination of the Doppler
shifts during transits also allowed them to determine the direction of the planet's orbital motion relative to
its parent star's rotation via the Rossiter–McLaughlin effect.[1]

Orbit
WASP-17b is thought to have a retrograde orbit (with a sky-projected inclination of the orbit normal
against the stellar spin axis of about 149°,[11] not to be confused with the line-of-sight inclination of the
orbit, given in the table, which is near 90° for all transiting planets), which would make it the first planet
discovered to have such an orbital motion. It was found by measuring the Rossiter–McLaughlin effect of
the planet on the star's Doppler signal as it transited, in which whichever of the star's hemispheres is
turning toward or away from Earth will show a slight blueshift or redshift which is dampened by the
transiting planet. Scientists are not yet sure why the planet orbits opposite to the star's rotation. Theories
include a gravitational slingshot resulting from a near-collision with another planet, or the intervention of
a smaller planet-like body working to gradually change WASP-17b's orbit by tilting it via the Kozai
mechanism.[12] Spin-orbit angle measurement was updated in 2012 to −148.7+7.7

−6.7°.[13]

Physical properties
WASP-17b has a radius between 1.5 and 2 times that of Jupiter and about half the mass.[1] Thus its mean
density is between 0.08 and 0.19 g/cm3,[1] compared with Jupiter's 1.326 g/cm3[14] and Earth's 5.515
g/cm3 (the density of water is 1 g/cm3). The unusually low density is thought to be a consequence of a
combination of the planet's orbital eccentricity and its proximity to its parent star (less than one seventh
of the distance between Mercury and the Sun), leading to tidal flexing and heating of its interior.[1] The
same mechanism is behind the intense volcanic activity of Jupiter's moon Io. WASP-39b has a similarly
low estimated density.

Exoplanetary sodium in the atmosphere of the WASP-17 has been detected in 2018,[3] but was not
confirmed by 2021. Instead, the spectral signatures of water, aluminium oxide (AlO) and titanium hydride
(TiH) were detected.[15] The water signature was confirmed in 2022, together with carbon dioxide
absorption.[16] In 2023, evidence of clouds made of quartz was detected on the planet by the James Webb
Space Telescope.[17][18]
