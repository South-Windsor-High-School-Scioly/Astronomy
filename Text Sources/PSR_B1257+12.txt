Nomenclature
Age 1–3[3][4][a] Gyr

The convention that arose for designating pulsars Other designations
was that of using the letters PSR (Pulsating Source Lich,[5] PSR 1257+12,
of Radio) followed by the pulsar's right ascension PSR J1300+1240, PSR 1300+1240
and degrees of declination. The modern convention
prefixes the older numbers with a B meaning the Database references

coordinates are for the 1950.0 epoch. All new SIMBAD data (https://simbad.cds.unis

pulsars have a J indicating 2000.0 coordinates and tra.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=P

also have declination including minutes. Pulsars that SR+B1257%2B12)

were discovered before 1993 tend to retain their B
names rather than use their J names, but all pulsars have a J name that provides more precise coordinates
of its location in the sky.[8]

On their discovery, the planets were designated PSR 1257+12 A, B, and C, ordered by increasing
distance. They were discovered before the convention that extrasolar planets receive designations
consisting of the star's name followed by lower-case Roman letters starting from "b", in order of
discovery, was established.[9] However, they are listed under the latter convention on astronomical
databases such as SIMBAD and the Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia, with A becoming b, B becoming c,
and C becoming d.



In July 2014, the International Astronomical Union launched NameExoWorlds, a process for giving
proper names to certain exoplanets and their host stars.[10] The process involved public nomination and
voting for the new names.[11] In December 2015, the IAU announced the winning names, submitted by
the Planetarium Südtirol Alto Adige in Karneid, Italy, were Lich for the pulsar and Draugr, Poltergeist,
and Phobetor for planets A, B, and C, respectively:[7][12]

A lich is an undead creature known for controlling other undead creatures with magic.
Draugr refers to undead creatures in Norse mythology.
Poltergeist is a name for supernatural beings that create physical disturbances, from the
German for "noisy ghost".
Phobetor is, in Ovid's Metamorphoses, one of the thousand sons of Somnus (Sleep) who
appears in dreams in the form of beasts.[13]

In 2016, the IAU organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN)[14] to catalog and standardize
proper names for stars (including stellar remnants). In its first bulletin of July 2016,[15] the WGSN
explicitly recognized the names of exoplanets and their host stars approved by the Executive Committee
Working Group Public Naming of Planets and Planetary Satellites, including the names of stars adopted
during the 2015 NameExoWorlds campaign. This stellar remnant is now so entered in the IAU Catalog of
Star Names.[6]

Pulsar

Discovery
PSR B1257+12 was discovered by the Polish astronomer Aleksander Wolszczan on 9 February 1990
using the Arecibo radio telescope. It is a millisecond pulsar, a kind of neutron star, with a rotation period
of 6.22 milliseconds (9,650 rpm), and was found to have anomalies in the pulsation period, which led to
investigations as to the cause of the irregular pulses. In 1992, Wolszczan and Dale Frail published a
famous paper on the first confirmed discovery of planets outside the Solar System. Using refined methods
one more planet was found orbiting this pulsar in 1994.

Characteristics
The pulsar is estimated to have a mass of 1.4 M☉, which is typical for most neutron stars and pulsars. The
radius is estimated to be around 10 kilometres or 6.2 miles (~1.5 × 10−5 R☉), also common for pulsars
and neutron stars. The pulsar is extremely hot, with a surface temperature of up to around 28,856 K
(28,583 °C; 51,481 °F). The pulsar formed one to three billion years ago from a white dwarf merger, a
pair of white dwarfs colliding and collapsing to form a rapidly spinning pulsar.[16]



The discovery stimulated a search for planets orbiting other pulsars, but it turned out such planets are
rare; only five other pulsar planets, orbiting PSR B1620−26, PSR B0943+10, PSR B0329+54, and PSR
J1719−1438, have been confirmed.

Planets
In 1992, Wolszczan and Frail discovered that the pulsar had two
planets. These were the first discovery of extrasolar planets to be
confirmed;[17][18] as pulsar planets, they surprised many
astronomers who expected to find planets only around main-
sequence stars. Additional uncertainty surrounded the system,
because of a claim of an earlier pulsar planet around PSR 1829-10
that had to be retracted due to errors in calculations. In 1994, an
additional planet was discovered. Additionally, this system may
have an asteroid belt or a Kuiper belt.

Artist's impression of the planets

The planets are believed to be the result of a second round of orbiting PSR B1257+12. The one in

planetary system formation as a result of two white dwarfs the foreground is planet "C".

merging with each other into a pulsar and a resulting disk of
material in orbit around the star.[16] Other scenarios include unusual supernova remnants or a quark-
nova.[19] However, the white dwarf–white dwarf merge model seems to be the most likely cause of the
formation of the planets.

Retracted claim of fourth orbital body
In 1996, a possible Saturn-like (100 Earth mass) gas giant was announced orbiting the pulsar at a distance
of about 40 AU (6.0 billion km; 3.7 billion mi).[20] The original hypothesis was retracted; a
reinterpretation of the data led to a new hypothesis of a dwarf planet one-fifth the size of Pluto orbiting
PSR B1257+12. It would have an average orbital distance of 2.4 AU (360 million km; 220 million mi)
with an orbital period of approximately 4.6 years.[21][22][23][24] The dwarf planet hypothesis was also



retracted because further observations showed that the pulsation anomalies previously thought to reveal a
fourth orbital body are "not periodic and can be fully explained in terms of slow changes in the pulsar's
dispersion measure".[23]
