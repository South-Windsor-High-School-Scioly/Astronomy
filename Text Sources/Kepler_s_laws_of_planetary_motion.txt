Kepler's laws of planetary motion
In astronomy, Kepler's laws of planetary motion, published by
Johannes Kepler absent the third law in 1609 and fully in 1619,
describe the orbits of planets around the Sun. The laws replaced
the circular orbits and epicycles in the heliocentric theory of
Nicolaus Copernicus with elliptical orbits and explained how
planetary velocities vary. The three laws state that:[1][2]

1. The orbit of a planet is an ellipse with the Sun at one of
the two foci.

2. A line segment joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out
equal areas during equal intervals of time.

3. The square of a planet's orbital period is proportional to
the cube of the length of the semi-major axis of its orbit. Illustration of Kepler's laws with two

Comparison to Copernicus
Johannes Kepler's laws improved the model of Copernicus. According to Copernicus:[3][4]

1. The planetary orbit is a circle with epicycles.
2. The Sun is approximately at the center of the orbit.
3. The speed of the planet in the main orbit is constant.

Despite being correct in saying that the planets revolved around the Sun, Copernicus was incorrect in
defining their orbits. Introducing physical explanations for movement in space beyond just geometry,
Kepler correctly defined the orbit of planets as follows:[1][2][5]: 53–54 

1. The planetary orbit is not a circle with epicycles, but an ellipse.
2. The Sun is not at the center but at a focal point of the elliptical orbit.



3. Neither the linear speed nor the angular speed of the planet in the orbit is constant, but the
area speed (closely linked historically with the concept of angular momentum) is constant.

The eccentricity of the orbit of the Earth makes the time from the March equinox to the September
equinox, around 186 days, unequal to the time from the September equinox to the March equinox, around
179 days. A diameter would cut the orbit into equal parts, but the plane through the Sun parallel to the
equator of the Earth cuts the orbit into two parts with areas in a 186 to 179 ratio, so the eccentricity of the
orbit of the Earth is approximately

which is close to the correct value (0.016710218). The accuracy of this calculation requires that the two
dates chosen be along the elliptical orbit's minor axis and that the midpoints of each half be along the
major axis. As the two dates chosen here are equinoxes, this will be correct when perihelion, the date the
Earth is closest to the Sun, falls on a solstice. The current perihelion, near January 4, is fairly close to the
solstice of December 21 or 22.

Nomenclature
It took nearly two centuries for the current formulation of Kepler's work to take on its settled form.
Voltaire's Eléments de la philosophie de Newton (Elements of Newton's Philosophy) of 1738 was the first
publication to use the terminology of "laws".[6][7] The Biographical Encyclopedia of Astronomers in its
article on Kepler (p. 620) states that the terminology of scientific laws for these discoveries was current at
least from the time of Joseph de Lalande.[8] It was the exposition of Robert Small, in An account of the
astronomical discoveries of Kepler (1814) that made up the set of three laws, by adding in the third.[9]

Small also claimed, against the history, that these were empirical laws, based on inductive
reasoning.[7][10]

Further, the current usage of "Kepler's Second Law" is something of a misnomer. Kepler had two
versions, related in a qualitative sense: the "distance law" and the "area law". The "area law" is what
became the Second Law in the set of three; but Kepler did himself not privilege it in that way.[11]

History
Kepler published his first two laws about planetary motion in 1609,[12] having found them by analyzing
the astronomical observations of Tycho Brahe.[13][14][15][5]: 53  Kepler's third law was published in
1619.[16][14] Kepler had believed in the Copernican model of the Solar System, which called for circular
orbits, but he could not reconcile Brahe's highly precise observations with a circular fit to Mars' orbit –
Mars coincidentally having the highest eccentricity of all planets except Mercury.[17] His first law
reflected this discovery.

In 1621, Kepler noted that his third law applies to the four brightest moons of Jupiter.[Nb 1] Godefroy
Wendelin also made this observation in 1643.[Nb 2] The second law, in the "area law" form, was contested
by Nicolaus Mercator in a book from 1664, but by 1670 his Philosophical Transactions were in its
favour.[18][19] As the century proceeded it became more widely accepted.[20] The reception in Germany



changed noticeably between 1688, the year in which Newton's Principia was published and was taken to
be basically Copernican, and 1690, by which time work of Gottfried Leibniz on Kepler had been
published.[21]

Newton was credited with understanding that the second law is not special to the inverse square law of
gravitation, being a consequence just of the radial nature of that law, whereas the other laws do depend on
the inverse square form of the attraction. Carl Runge and Wilhelm Lenz much later identified a symmetry
principle in the phase space of planetary motion (the orthogonal group O(4) acting) which accounts for
the first and third laws in the case of Newtonian gravitation, as conservation of angular momentum does
via rotational symmetry for the second law.[22]

Formulary
The mathematical model of the kinematics of a planet subject to the laws allows a large range of further
calculations.

First law
Kepler's first law states that:

The orbit of every planet is an ellipse with the sun at one of the two foci.

Mathematically, an ellipse can be represented by the formula:

where  is the semi-latus rectum, ε is the eccentricity of the
ellipse, r is the distance from the Sun to the planet, and θ is the
angle to the planet's current position from its closest approach, as
seen from the Sun. So (r, θ) are polar coordinates.

Kepler's first law placing the Sun at
For an ellipse 0 < ε < 1 ; in the limiting case ε = 0, the orbit is a one of the foci of an elliptical orbit

circle with the Sun at the centre (i.e. where there is zero
eccentricity).

At θ = 0°, perihelion, the distance is minimum

At θ = 90° and at θ = 270° the distance is equal to .

At θ = 180°, aphelion, the distance is maximum (by definition, aphelion is – invariably – perihelion plus
180°)



The semi-major axis a is the arithmetic mean between rmin and
rmax:

The semi-minor axis b is the geometric mean between rmin and
rmax:

Heliocentric coordinate system (r, θ)
for ellipse. Also shown are: semi-
major axis a, semi-minor axis b and
semi-latus rectum p; center of

The semi-latus rectum p is the harmonic mean between rmin and ellipse and its two foci marked by

rmax: large dots. For θ = 0°, r = rmin and
for θ = 180°, r = rmax.

The eccentricity ε is the coefficient of variation between rmin and rmax:

The area of the ellipse is

The special case of a circle is ε = 0, resulting in r = p = rmin = rmax = a = b and A = πr2.

Second law
Kepler's second law states that:

A line joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time.[23]

The orbital radius and angular velocity of the planet in the elliptical orbit will vary. This is shown in the
animation: the planet travels faster when closer to the Sun, then slower when farther from the Sun.
Kepler's second law states that the blue sector has constant area.

History and proofs
Kepler notably arrived at this law through assumptions that were either only approximately true or
outright false and can be outlined as follows:



1. Planets are pushed around the Sun by a force from the
Sun. This false assumption relies on incorrect
Aristotelian physics that an object needs to be pushed to
maintain motion.

2. The propelling force from the Sun is inversely
proportional to the distance from the Sun. Kepler
reasoned this, believing that gravity spreading in three
dimensions would be a waste, since the planets
inhabited a plane. Thus, an inverse instead of the
[correct] inverse square law. The same (blue) area is swept out in

3. Because Kepler believed that force would be a fixed time period. The green arrow

proportional to velocity, it followed from statements #1 is velocity. The purple arrow directed

and #2 that velocity would be inverse to the distance towards the Sun is the acceleration.

from the sun. This is also an incorrect tenet of The other two purple arrows are

Aristotelian physics. acceleration components parallel
and perpendicular to the velocity.

4. Since velocity is inverse to time, the distance from the
sun would be proportional to the time to cover a small
piece of the orbit. This is approximately true for elliptical
orbits.

5. The area swept out is proportional to the overall time. This is also approximately true.
6. The orbits of a planet are circular (Kepler discovered his Second Law before his First Law,

which contradicts this).
Nevertheless, the result of the Second Law is exactly true, as it is logically equivalent to the conservation
of angular momentum, which is true for any body experiencing a radially symmetric force.[24] A correct
proof can be shown through this. Since the cross product of two vectors gives the area of a parallelogram
possessing sides of those vectors, the triangular area dA swept out in a short period of time is given by
half the cross product of the r and dx vectors, for some short piece of the orbit, dx.

 for a small piece of the orbit dx and time to cover it dt.

Thus 

Since the final expression is proportional to the total angular momentum , Kepler's equal area law
will hold for any system that conserves angular momentum. Since any radial force will produce no torque
on the planet's motion, angular momentum will be conserved.

In terms of elliptical parameters
In a small time  the planet sweeps out a small triangle having base line  and height  and area

, so the constant areal velocity is

The area enclosed by the elliptical orbit is . So the period  satisfies



and the mean motion of the planet around the Sun

satisfies

And so,

In each case, the area of all sectors depicted is identical.

Third law
Kepler's third law states that:

The ratio of the square of an object's orbital period with the cube of the semi-major axis of its
orbit is the same for all objects orbiting the same primary.

This captures the relationship between the distance of planets from the Sun, and their orbital periods.

Kepler enunciated in 1619[16] this third law in a laborious attempt to determine what he viewed as the
"music of the spheres" according to precise laws, and express it in terms of musical notation.[25] It was
therefore known as the harmonic law.[26] The original form of this law (referring to not the semi-major
axis, but rather a "mean distance") holds true only for planets with small eccentricities near zero.[27]

Using Newton's law of gravitation (published 1687), this relation can be found in the case of a circular
orbit by setting the centripetal force equal to the gravitational force:



Then, expressing the angular velocity ω in terms of the orbital period  and then rearranging, results in
Kepler's Third Law:

A more detailed derivation can be done with general elliptical orbits, instead of circles, as well as orbiting
the center of mass, instead of just the large mass. This results in replacing a circular radius, , with the
semi-major axis, , of the elliptical relative motion of one mass relative to the other, as well as replacing
the large mass  with . However, with planet masses being so much smaller than the Sun, this
correction is often ignored. The full corresponding formula is:

where  is the mass of the Sun,  is the mass of the planet,  is the gravitational constant,  is the
orbital period and  is the elliptical semi-major axis, and  is the astronomical unit, the average
distance from earth to the sun.

The following table shows the data used by Kepler to empirically derive his law:

Kepler became aware of John Napier's recent invention of logarithms and log-log graphs before he
discovered the pattern.[28]

Upon finding this pattern Kepler wrote:[29]

I first believed I was dreaming... But it is absolutely certain and exact that the ratio which exists
between the period times of any two planets is precisely the ratio of the 3/2th power of the
mean distance.

Planetary acceleration
Isaac Newton computed in his Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica the acceleration of a planet
moving according to Kepler's first and second laws.

1. The direction of the acceleration is towards the Sun.
2. The magnitude of the acceleration is inversely proportional to the square of the planet's

distance from the Sun (the inverse square law).
This implies that the Sun may be the physical cause of the acceleration of planets. However, Newton
states in his Principia that he considers forces from a mathematical point of view, not a physical, thereby
taking an instrumentalist view.[30] Moreover, he does not assign a cause to gravity.[31]

Newton defined the force acting on a planet to be the product of its mass and the acceleration (see
Newton's laws of motion). So:

1. Every planet is attracted towards the Sun.
2. The force acting on a planet is directly proportional to the mass of the planet and is inversely

proportional to the square of its distance from the Sun.
The Sun plays an unsymmetrical part, which is unjustified. So he assumed, in Newton's law of universal
gravitation:

1. All bodies in the Solar System attract one another.
2. The force between two bodies is in direct proportion to the product of their masses and in

inverse proportion to the square of the distance between them.
As the planets have small masses compared to that of the Sun, the orbits conform approximately to
Kepler's laws. Newton's model improves upon Kepler's model, and fits actual observations more
accurately. (See two-body problem.)



Below comes the detailed calculation of the acceleration of a planet moving according to Kepler's first
and second laws.

Acceleration vector
From the heliocentric point of view consider the vector to the planet  where  is the distance to the
planet and  is a unit vector pointing towards the planet.

where  is the unit vector whose direction is 90 degrees counterclockwise of , and  is the polar angle,
and where a dot on top of the variable signifies differentiation with respect to time.

Differentiate the position vector twice to obtain the velocity vector and the acceleration vector:

So

where the radial acceleration is

and the transversal acceleration is

Inverse square law
Kepler's second law says that

is constant.

The transversal acceleration  is zero:

So the acceleration of a planet obeying Kepler's second law is directed towards the Sun.

The radial acceleration  is



Kepler's first law states that the orbit is described by the equation:

Differentiating with respect to time

or

Differentiating once more

The radial acceleration  satisfies

Substituting the equation of the ellipse gives

The relation  gives the simple final result

This means that the acceleration vector  of any planet obeying Kepler's first and second law satisfies the
inverse square law

where

is a constant, and  is the unit vector pointing from the Sun towards the planet, and  is the distance
between the planet and the Sun.

Since mean motion  where  is the period, according to Kepler's third law,  has the same value
for all the planets. So the inverse square law for planetary accelerations applies throughout the entire
Solar System.



The inverse square law is a differential equation. The solutions to this differential equation include the
Keplerian motions, as shown, but they also include motions where the orbit is a hyperbola or parabola or
a straight line. (See Kepler orbit.)

Newton's law of gravitation
By Newton's second law, the gravitational force that acts on the planet is:

where  is the mass of the planet and  has the same value for all planets in the Solar System.
According to Newton's third law, the Sun is attracted to the planet by a force of the same magnitude.
Since the force is proportional to the mass of the planet, under the symmetric consideration, it should also
be proportional to the mass of the Sun, . So

where  is the gravitational constant.

The acceleration of Solar System body number i is, according to Newton's laws:

where  is the mass of body j,  is the distance between body i and body j,  is the unit vector from
body i towards body j, and the vector summation is over all bodies in the Solar System, besides i itself.

In the special case where there are only two bodies in the Solar System, Earth and Sun, the acceleration
becomes

which is the acceleration of the Kepler motion. So this Earth moves around the Sun according to Kepler's
laws.

If the two bodies in the Solar System are Moon and Earth the acceleration of the Moon becomes

So in this approximation, the Moon moves around the Earth according to Kepler's laws.

In the three-body case the accelerations are



These accelerations are not those of Kepler orbits, and the three-body problem is complicated. But
Keplerian approximation is the basis for perturbation calculations. (See Lunar theory.)

Position as a function of time
Kepler used his two first laws to compute the position of a planet as a function of time. His method
involves the solution of a transcendental equation called Kepler's equation.

The procedure for calculating the heliocentric polar coordinates (r,θ) of a planet as a function of the time
t since perihelion, is the following five steps:

1. Compute the mean motion n = (2π rad)/P, where P is the period.
2. Compute the mean anomaly M = nt, where t is the time since perihelion.
3. Compute the eccentric anomaly E by solving Kepler's equation:

where  is the eccentricity.
4. Compute the true anomaly θ by solving the equation:

5. Compute the heliocentric distance r:

where  is the semimajor axis.
The position polar coordinates (r,θ) can now be written as a Cartesian vector  and the

Cartesian velocity vector can then be calculated as , where  is
the standard gravitational parameter.[32]

The important special case of circular orbit, ε = 0, gives θ = E = M. Because the uniform circular motion
was considered to be normal, a deviation from this motion was considered an anomaly.

The proof of this procedure is shown below.

Mean anomaly, M
The Keplerian problem assumes an elliptical orbit and the four points:

s the Sun (at one focus of ellipse);
z the perihelion
c the center of the ellipse
p the planet

and

 distance between center and perihelion, the semimajor axis,

The problem is to compute the polar coordinates (r,θ) of the planet from

Kepler's calculation of θ.
It is solved in steps. Kepler considered the circle with the major axis as a The Sun (located at the

The sector areas are related by areas by positioning of point

is by Kepler's second law proportional to time since perihelion. So the mean anomaly, M, is proportional
to time since perihelion, t.

where n is the mean motion.

Eccentric anomaly, E
When the mean anomaly M is computed, the goal is to compute the true anomaly θ. The function θ = f(M)
is, however, not elementary.[33] Kepler's solution is to use

x as seen from the centre, the eccentric anomaly as an intermediate variable, and first compute E as a
function of M by solving Kepler's equation below, and then compute the true anomaly θ from the
eccentric anomaly E. Here are the details.



Division by a2/2 gives Kepler's equation

This equation gives M as a function of E. Determining E for a given M is the inverse problem. Iterative
numerical algorithms are commonly used.

Having computed the eccentric anomaly E, the next step is to calculate the true anomaly θ.

But note: Cartesian position coordinates with reference to the center of ellipse are (a cos E, b sin E)

With reference to the Sun (with coordinates (c,0) = (ae,0) ), r = (a cos E – ae, b sin E)

True anomaly would be arctan(ry/rx), magnitude of r would be √r · r .

True anomaly, θ
Note from the figure that

so that

Dividing by  and inserting from Kepler's first law

to get

The result is a usable relationship between the eccentric anomaly E and the true anomaly θ.

A computationally more convenient form follows by substituting into the trigonometric identity:

Get

Multiplying by 1 + ε gives the result



This is the third step in the connection between time and position in the orbit.

Distance, r
The fourth step is to compute the heliocentric distance r from the true anomaly θ by Kepler's first law:

Using the relation above between θ and E the final equation for the distance r is:

Explanatory notes
1. In 1621, Johannes Kepler noted that Jupiter's moons obey (approximately) his third law in

his Epitome Astronomiae Copernicanae [Epitome of Copernican Astronomy] (Linz ("Lentiis
ad Danubium"), (Austria): Johann Planck, 1622), book 4, part 2, pages 554–555 (https://boo
ks.google.com/books?id=wa2SE_6ZL7YC&pg=PA554). From pp. 554–555: " ... plane ut est
cum sex planet circa Solem, ... prodit Marius in suo mundo Ioviali ista 3.5.8.13 (vel 14.
Galilæo) ... Periodica vero tempora prodit idem Marius ... sunt maiora simplis, minora vero
duplis." (... just as it is clearly [true] among the six planets around the Sun, so also it is
among the four [moons] of Jupiter, because around the body of Jupiter any [satellite] that
can go farther from it, orbits slower, and even that [orbit's period] is not in the same
proportion, but greater [than the distance from Jupiter]; that is, 3/2 (sescupla) of the
proportion of each of the distances from Jupiter, which is clearly the very [proportion] as is
used for the six planets above. In his [book] The World of Jupiter [Mundus Jovialis, 1614],
[Simon Mayr or] "Marius" [1573–1624] presents these distances, from Jupiter, of the four
[moons] of Jupiter: 3, 5, 8, 13 (or 14 [according to] Galileo) [Note: The distances of Jupiter's
moons from Jupiter are expressed as multiples of Jupiter's diameter.] ... Mayr presents their
time periods: 1 day 18 1/2 hours, 3 days 13 1/3 hours, 7 days 2 hours, 16 days 18 hours: for
all [of these data] the proportion is greater than double, thus greater than [the proportion] of
the distances 3, 5, 8, 13 or 14, although less than [the proportion] of the squares, which
double the proportions of the distances, namely 9, 25, 64, 169 or 196, just as [a power of]
3/2 is also greater than 1 but less than 2.)

2. Godefroy Wendelin wrote a letter to Giovanni Battista Riccioli about the relationship
between the distances of the Jovian moons from Jupiter and the periods of their orbits,
showing that the periods and distances conformed to Kepler's third law. See: Joanne
Baptista Riccioli, Almagestum novum ... (Bologna (Bononia), (Italy): Victor Benati, 1651),



volume 1, page 492 Scholia III. (https://books.google.com/books?id=_mJDAAAAcAAJ&pg=

movement and distances of Jupiter's satellites.) From p. 492: "III. Non minus Kepleriana

(No less clever [than] Kepler's is the most keen astronomer Wendelin's investigation of the
proportion of the periods and distances of Jupiter's satellites, which he had communicated
to me with great generosity [in] a very long and very learned letter. So, just as in [the case
of] the larger planets, the planets' mean distances from the Sun are respectively in the 3/2
ratio of their periods; so the distances of these minor planets of Jupiter from Jupiter (which
are 3, 5, 8, and 14) are respectively in the 3/2 ratio of [their] periods (which are 1.769 days
for the innermost [Io], 3.554 days for the next to the innermost [Europa], 7.164 days for the

13. In his Astronomia nova, Kepler presented only a proof that Mars' orbit is elliptical. Evidence
that the other known planets' orbits are elliptical was presented only in 1621.
See: Johannes Kepler, Astronomia nova ... (1609), p. 285. (https://archive.org/stream/Astron
omianovaa00Kepl#page/284/mode/2up) After having rejected circular and oval orbits,
Kepler concluded that Mars' orbit must be elliptical. From the top of page 285: "Ergo ellipsis
est Planetæ iter; ... " (Thus, an ellipse is the planet's [i.e., Mars'] path; ... ) Later on the same
page: " ... ut sequenti capite patescet: ubi simul etiam demonstrabitur, nullam Planetæ
relinqui figuram Orbitæ, præterquam perfecte ellipticam; ... " ( ... as will be revealed in the
next chapter: where it will also then be proved that any figure of the planet's orbit must be
relinquished, except a perfect ellipse; ... ) And then: "Caput LIX. Demonstratio, quod orbita
Martis, ... , fiat perfecta ellipsis: ... " (Chapter 59. Proof that Mars' orbit, ... is a perfect ellipse:
... ) The geometric proof that Mars' orbit is an ellipse appears as Protheorema XI on pages
289–290.
Kepler stated that every planet travels in elliptical orbits having the Sun at one focus in:

(Linz ("Lentiis ad Danubium"), (Austria): Johann Planck, 1622), book 5, part 1, III. De Figura

ooks?id=wa2SE_6ZL7YC&pg=PA658) From p. 658: "Ellipsin fieri orbitam planetæ ... " (Of
an ellipse is made a planet's orbit ... ). From p. 659: " ... Sole (Foco altero huius ellipsis) ... "
( ... the Sun (the other focus of this ellipse) ... ).

15. In his Astronomia nova ... (1609), Kepler did not present his second law in its modern form.
He did that only in his Epitome of 1621. Furthermore, in 1609, he presented his second law
in two different forms, which scholars call the "distance law" and the "area law".

His "distance law" is presented in: "Caput XXXII. Virtutem quam Planetam movet in
circulum attenuari cum discessu a fonte." (Chapter 32. The force that moves a planet
circularly weakens with distance from the source.) See: Johannes Kepler, Astronomia
nova ... (1609), pp. 165–167. (https://archive.org/stream/Astronomianovaa00Kepl#page/
164/mode/2up) On page 167 (https://archive.org/stream/Astronomianovaa00Kepl#page/
166/mode/2up), Kepler states: " ... , quanto longior est αδ quam αε, tanto diutius moratur
Planeta in certo aliquo arcui excentrici apud δ, quam in æquali arcu excentrici apud ε." (
... , as αδ is longer than αε, so much longer will a planet remain on a certain arc of the
eccentric near δ than on an equal arc of the eccentric near ε.) That is, the farther a
planet is from the Sun (at the point α), the slower it moves along its orbit, so a radius
from the Sun to a planet passes through equal areas in equal times. However, as Kepler
presented it, his argument is accurate only for circles, not ellipses.
His "area law" is presented in: "Caput LIX. Demonstratio, quod orbita Martis, ... , fiat
perfecta ellipsis: ... " (Chapter 59. Proof that Mars' orbit, ... , is a perfect ellipse: ... ),
Protheorema XIV and XV, pp. 291–295. (https://archive.org/stream/Astronomianovaa00
Kepl#page/284/mode/2up) On the top p. 294, it reads: "Arcum ellipseos, cujus moras
metitur area AKN, debere terminari in LK, ut sit AM." (The arc of the ellipse, of which the
duration is delimited [i.e., measured] by the area AKM, should be terminated in LK, so
that it [i.e., the arc] is AM.) In other words, the time that Mars requires to move along an
arc AM of its elliptical orbit is measured by the area of the segment AMN of the ellipse
(where N is the position of the Sun), which in turn is proportional to the section AKN of
the circle that encircles the ellipse and that is tangent to it. Therefore, the area that is
swept out by a radius from the Sun to Mars as Mars moves along an arc of its elliptical
orbit is proportional to the time that Mars requires to move along that arc. Thus, a radius
from the Sun to Mars sweeps out equal areas in equal times.

In 1621, Kepler restated his second law for any planet: Johannes Kepler, Epitome
Astronomiae Copernicanae [Summary of Copernican Astronomy] (Linz ("Lentiis ad
Danubium"), (Austria): Johann Planck, 1622), book 5, page 668 (https://books.google.com/b
ooks?id=wa2SE_6ZL7YC&pg=PA668). From page 668: "Dictum quidem est in superioribus,
divisa orbita in particulas minutissimas æquales: accrescete iis moras planetæ per eas, in
proportione intervallorum inter eas & Solem." (It has been said above that, if the orbit of the
planet is divided into the smallest equal parts, the times of the planet in them increase in the
ratio of the distances between them and the sun.) That is, a planet's speed along its orbit is
inversely proportional to its distance from the Sun. (The remainder of the paragraph makes
clear that Kepler was referring to what is now called angular velocity.)

16. Johannes Kepler, Harmonices Mundi [The Harmony of the World] (Linz, (Austria): Johann
Planck, 1619), book 5, chapter 3, p. 189. (https://archive.org/details/ioanniskepplerih00kepl/
page/189) From the bottom of p. 189: "Sed res est certissima exactissimaque quod
proportio qua est inter binorum quorumcunque Planetarum tempora periodica, sit præcise
sesquialtera proportionis mediarum distantiarum, ... " (But it is absolutely certain and exact
that the proportion between the periodic times of any two planets is precisely the
sesquialternate proportion [i.e., the ratio of 3:2] of their mean distances, ... ")

is the "area" form of Kepler's second law])
