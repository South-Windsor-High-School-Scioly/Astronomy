Hubble's law
Hubble's law, also known as the Hubble–Lemaître law,[1] is the observation in
physical cosmology that galaxies are moving away from Earth at speeds proportional
to their distance. In other words, the farther they are, the faster they are moving away
from Earth. The velocity of the galaxies has been determined by their redshift, a shift
of the light they emit toward the red end of the visible light spectrum. The discovery
of Hubble's law is attributed to Edwin Hubble's work published in 1929.[2]

Hubble's law is considered the first observational basis for the expansion of the
universe, and today it serves as one of the pieces of evidence most often cited in
support of the Big Bang model.[3][4] The motion of astronomical objects due solely
to this expansion is known as the Hubble flow.[5] It is described by the equation
v = H0D, with H0 the constant of proportionality—the Hubble constant—between An analogy for explaining Hubble's law,

definition of velocity.)

The Hubble constant is most frequently quoted in (km/s)/Mpc, thus giving the speed in km/s of a galaxy 1 megaparsec
(3.09 × 1019 km) away, and its value is about 70 (km/s)/Mpc. However, crossing out units reveals that H0 is a unit of frequency
(SI unit: s−1) and the reciprocal of H0 is known as the Hubble time. The Hubble constant can also be interpreted as the relative
rate of expansion. In this form H0 = 7%/Gyr, meaning that at the current rate of expansion it takes a billion years for an unbound
structure to grow by 7%.

Although widely attributed to Edwin Hubble,[6][7][8] the notion of the universe expanding at a calculable rate was first derived
from general relativity equations in 1922 by Alexander Friedmann. Friedmann published a set of equations, now known as the
Friedmann equations, showing that the universe might be expanding, and presenting the expansion speed if that were the case.[9]

Before Hubble, German astronomer Carl Wilhelm Wirtz had, in two publications dating 1922 [10] and 1924,[11] already deduced
with his own data that galaxies that appeared smaller and dimmer had larger redshifts and thus that more distant galaxies recede
faster from the observer. Then Georges Lemaître, in a 1927 article, independently derived that the universe might be expanding,
observed the proportionality between recessional velocity of, and distance to, distant bodies, and suggested an estimated value for
the proportionality constant; this constant, when Edwin Hubble confirmed the existence of cosmic expansion and determined a
more accurate value for it two years later, came to be known by his name as the Hubble constant.[3][12][13][14][2] Hubble inferred
the recession velocity of the objects from their redshifts, many of which were earlier measured and related to velocity by Vesto
Slipher in 1917.[15][16][17] Combining Slipher's velocities with Henrietta Swan Leavitt's intergalactic distance calculations and
methodology allowed Hubble to better calculate an expansion rate for the universe.[18]

Though the Hubble constant H0 is constant at any given moment in time, the Hubble parameter H, of which the Hubble
constant is the current value, varies with time, so the term constant is sometimes thought of as somewhat of a misnomer.[19][20]

Discovery
A decade before Hubble made his observations, a number of physicists and mathematicians had established a consistent theory of
an expanding universe by using Einstein field equations of general relativity. Applying the most general principles to the nature of
the universe yielded a dynamic solution that conflicted with the then-prevalent notion of a static universe.

Slipher's observations



In 1912, Vesto M. Slipher measured the first
Doppler shift of a "spiral nebula" (the obsolete
term for spiral galaxies) and soon discovered that
almost all such nebulae were receding from Earth.
He did not grasp the cosmological implications of
this fact, and indeed at the time it was highly
controversial whether or not these nebulae were
"island universes" outside the Milky Way
galaxy.[22][23]

FLRW equations
In 1922, Alexander Friedmann derived his
Friedmann equations from Einstein field
equations, showing that the universe might expand
at a rate calculable by the equations.[24] The
parameter used by Friedmann is known today as
the scale factor and can be considered as a scale
invariant form of the proportionality constant of
Hubble's law. Georges Lemaître independently
found a similar solution in his 1927 paper Three steps to the Hubble constant[21]

discussed in the following section. The Friedmann
equations are derived by inserting the metric for a
homogeneous and isotropic universe into Einstein's field equations for a fluid with a given density and pressure. This idea of an
expanding spacetime would eventually lead to the Big Bang and Steady State theories of cosmology.

Lemaître's equation
In 1927, two years before Hubble published his own article, the Belgian priest and astronomer Georges Lemaître was the first to
publish research deriving what is now known as Hubble's law. According to the Canadian astronomer Sidney van den Bergh, "the
1927 discovery of the expansion of the universe by Lemaître was published in French in a low-impact journal. In the 1931 high-
impact English translation of this article, a critical equation was changed by omitting reference to what is now known as the
Hubble constant."[25] It is now known that the alterations in the translated paper were carried out by Lemaître himself.[13][26]

Shape of the universe
Before the advent of modern cosmology, there was considerable talk about the size and shape of the universe. In 1920, the
Shapley–Curtis debate took place between Harlow Shapley and Heber D. Curtis over this issue. Shapley argued for a small
universe the size of the Milky Way galaxy, and Curtis argued that the universe was much larger. The issue was resolved in the
coming decade with Hubble's improved observations.

Cepheid variable stars outside the Milky Way
Edwin Hubble did most of his professional astronomical observing work at Mount Wilson Observatory,[27] home to the world's
most powerful telescope at the time. His observations of Cepheid variable stars in "spiral nebulae" enabled him to calculate the
distances to these objects. Surprisingly, these objects were discovered to be at distances which placed them well outside the Milky
Way. They continued to be called nebulae, and it was only gradually that the term galaxies replaced it.

Combining redshifts with distance measurements
The parameters that appear in Hubble's law, velocities and distances, are not directly measured. In reality we determine, say, a
supernova brightness, which provides information about its distance, and the redshift z = ∆λ/λ of its spectrum of radiation.
Hubble correlated brightness and parameter z.

Combining his measurements of galaxy distances with Vesto Slipher and Milton Humason's measurements of the redshifts
associated with the galaxies, Hubble discovered a rough proportionality between redshift of an object and its distance. Though
there was considerable scatter (now known to be caused by peculiar velocities—the 'Hubble flow' is used to refer to the region of



space far enough out that the recession velocity is larger than local peculiar velocities),
Hubble was able to plot a trend line from the 46 galaxies he studied and obtain a value
for the Hubble constant of 500 (km/s)/Mpc (much higher than the currently accepted
value due to errors in his distance calibrations; see cosmic distance ladder for
details).[31]

Hubble diagram
Hubble's law can be easily depicted in a "Hubble diagram" in which the velocity
(assumed approximately proportional to the redshift) of an object is plotted with respect Fit of redshift velocities to Hubble's
to its distance from the observer.[32] A straight line of positive slope on this diagram is law.[28] Various estimates for the

created to counter the expansion or contraction to get a perfect static and flat universe.[33] After Hubble's discovery that the
universe was, in fact, expanding, Einstein called his faulty assumption that the universe is static his "biggest mistake".[33] On its
own, general relativity could predict the expansion of the universe, which (through observations such as the bending of light by
large masses, or the precession of the orbit of Mercury) could be experimentally observed and compared to his theoretical
calculations using particular solutions of the equations he had originally formulated.

In 1931, Einstein went to Mount Wilson Observatory to thank Hubble for providing the observational basis for modern
cosmology.[34]

The cosmological constant has regained attention in recent decades as a hypothetical explanation for dark energy.[35]

Interpretation
The discovery of the linear relationship between redshift and distance, coupled with a
supposed linear relation between recessional velocity and redshift, yields a straightforward
mathematical expression for Hubble's law as follows:

where

v is the recessional velocity, typically expressed in km/s.

Hubble's law is considered a fundamental relation between recessional velocity and
distance. However, the relation between recessional velocity and redshift depends on the cosmological model adopted and is not
established except for small redshifts.

For distances D larger than the radius of the Hubble sphere rHS, objects recede at a rate faster than the speed of light (See Uses of
the proper distance for a discussion of the significance of this):



Since the Hubble "constant" is a constant only in space, not in time, the radius of the Hubble sphere may increase or decrease over
various time intervals. The subscript '0' indicates the value of the Hubble constant today.[28] Current evidence suggests that the
expansion of the universe is accelerating (see Accelerating universe), meaning that for any given galaxy, the recession velocity
dD/dt is increasing over time as the galaxy moves to greater and greater distances; however, the Hubble parameter is actually
thought to be decreasing with time, meaning that if we were to look at some fixed distance D and watch a series of different
galaxies pass that distance, later galaxies would pass that distance at a smaller velocity than earlier ones.[37]

Redshift velocity and recessional velocity
Redshift can be measured by determining the wavelength of a known transition, such as hydrogen α-lines for distant quasars, and
finding the fractional shift compared to a stationary reference. Thus, redshift is a quantity unambiguous for experimental
observation. The relation of redshift to recessional velocity is another matter.[38]

Redshift velocity
The redshift z is often described as a redshift velocity, which is the recessional velocity that would produce the same redshift if it
were caused by a linear Doppler effect (which, however, is not the case, as the shift is caused in part by a cosmological expansion
of space, and because the velocities involved are too large to use a non-relativistic formula for Doppler shift). This redshift
velocity can easily exceed the speed of light.[39] In other words, to determine the redshift velocity vrs, the relation:

is used.[40][41] That is, there is no fundamental difference between redshift velocity and redshift: they are rigidly proportional, and
not related by any theoretical reasoning. The motivation behind the "redshift velocity" terminology is that the redshift velocity
agrees with the velocity from a low-velocity simplification of the so-called Fizeau–Doppler formula[42]

Here, λo, λe are the observed and emitted wavelengths respectively. The "redshift velocity" vrs is not so simply related to real
velocity at larger velocities, however, and this terminology leads to confusion if interpreted as a real velocity. Next, the connection
between redshift or redshift velocity and recessional velocity is discussed.[43]

Recessional velocity
Suppose R(t) is called the scale factor of the universe, and increases as the universe expands in a manner that depends upon the
cosmological model selected. Its meaning is that all measured proper distances D(t) between co-moving points increase
proportionally to R. (The co-moving points are not moving relative to each other except as a result of the expansion of space.) In
other words:

where t0 is some reference time.[44] If light is emitted from a galaxy at time te and received by us at t0, it is redshifted due to the
expansion of space, and this redshift z is simply:

Suppose a galaxy is at distance D, and this distance changes with time at a rate dtD. We call this rate of recession the "recession
velocity" vr:



We now define the Hubble constant as

and discover the Hubble law:

From this perspective, Hubble's law is a fundamental relation between (i) the recessional velocity contributed by the expansion of
space and (ii) the distance to an object; the connection between redshift and distance is a crutch used to connect Hubble's law with
observations. This law can be related to redshift z approximately by making a Taylor series expansion:

If the distance is not too large, all other complications of the model become small corrections, and the time interval is simply the
distance divided by the speed of light:

or

According to this approach, the relation cz = vr is an approximation valid at low redshifts, to be replaced by a relation at large
redshifts that is model-dependent. See velocity-redshift figure.

Observability of parameters
Strictly speaking, neither v nor D in the formula are directly observable, because they are properties now of a galaxy, whereas our
observations refer to the galaxy in the past, at the time that the light we currently see left it.

For relatively nearby galaxies (redshift z much less than one), v and D will not have changed much, and v can be estimated using
the formula v = zc where c is the speed of light. This gives the empirical relation found by Hubble.

For distant galaxies, v (or D) cannot be calculated from z without specifying a detailed model for how H changes with time. The
redshift is not even directly related to the recession velocity at the time the light set out, but it does have a simple interpretation:
(1 + z) is the factor by which the universe has expanded while the photon was traveling towards the observer.

Expansion velocity vs. peculiar velocity
In using Hubble's law to determine distances, only the velocity due to the expansion of the universe can be used. Since
gravitationally interacting galaxies move relative to each other independent of the expansion of the universe,[45] these relative
velocities, called peculiar velocities, need to be accounted for in the application of Hubble's law. Such peculiar velocities give rise
to redshift-space distortions.

Time-dependence of Hubble parameter
The parameter H is commonly called the "Hubble constant", but that is a misnomer since it is constant in space only at a fixed
time; it varies with time in nearly all cosmological models, and all observations of far distant objects are also observations into the
distant past, when the "constant" had a different value. "Hubble parameter" is a more correct term, with H0 denoting the present-
day value.

Another common source of confusion is that the accelerating universe does not imply that the Hubble parameter is actually
increasing with time; since , in most accelerating models  increases relatively faster than , so H decreases
with time. (The recession velocity of one chosen galaxy does increase, but different galaxies passing a sphere of fixed radius cross
the sphere more slowly at later times.)



On defining the dimensionless deceleration parameter , it follows that

From this it is seen that the Hubble parameter is decreasing with time, unless q < -1; the latter can only occur if the universe
contains phantom energy, regarded as theoretically somewhat improbable.

However, in the standard Lambda cold dark matter model (Lambda-CDM or ΛCDM model), q will tend to −1 from above in the
distant future as the cosmological constant becomes increasingly dominant over matter; this implies that H will approach from
above to a constant value of ≈ 57 (km/s)/Mpc, and the scale factor of the universe will then grow exponentially in time.

Idealized Hubble's law
The mathematical derivation of an idealized Hubble's law for a uniformly expanding universe is a fairly elementary theorem of
geometry in 3-dimensional Cartesian/Newtonian coordinate space, which, considered as a metric space, is entirely homogeneous
and isotropic (properties do not vary with location or direction). Simply stated, the theorem is this:

Any two points which are moving away from the origin, each along straight lines and with speed proportional to
distance from the origin, will be moving away from each other with a speed proportional to their distance apart.

In fact, this applies to non-Cartesian spaces as long as they are locally homogeneous and isotropic, specifically to the negatively
and positively curved spaces frequently considered as cosmological models (see shape of the universe).

An observation stemming from this theorem is that seeing objects recede from us on Earth is not an indication that Earth is near to
a center from which the expansion is occurring, but rather that every observer in an expanding universe will see objects receding
from them.

Ultimate fate and age of the universe
The value of the Hubble parameter changes over time, either
increasing or decreasing depending on the value of the so-
called deceleration parameter q, which is defined by

In a universe with a deceleration parameter equal to zero, it
follows that H = 1/t, where t is the time since the Big Bang. A
non-zero, time-dependent value of q simply requires
integration of the Friedmann equations backwards from the
present time to the time when the comoving horizon size was
zero.

It was long thought that q was positive, indicating that the
expansion is slowing down due to gravitational attraction. This The age and ultimate fate of the universe can be determined by
would imply an age of the universe less than 1/H (which is measuring the Hubble constant today and extrapolating with the
about 14 billion years). For instance, a value for q of 1/2 (once observed value of the deceleration parameter, uniquely
favoured by most theorists) would give the age of the universe characterized by values of density parameters (ΩM for matter and
as 2/(3H). The discovery in 1998 that q is apparently negative ΩΛ for dark energy). A "closed universe" with ΩM > 1 and ΩΛ = 0
means that the universe could actually be older than 1/H. comes to an end in a Big Crunch and is considerably younger than

However, estimates of the age of the universe are very close to its Hubble age. An "open universe" with ΩM ≤ 1 and ΩΛ = 0
1/H expands forever and has an age that is closer to its Hubble age.

. For the accelerating universe with nonzero ΩΛ that we inhabit, the
age of the universe is coincidentally very close to the Hubble age.

Olbers' paradox



The expansion of space summarized by the Big Bang interpretation of Hubble's law is relevant to the old conundrum known as
Olbers' paradox: If the universe were infinite in size, static, and filled with a uniform distribution of stars, then every line of sight
in the sky would end on a star, and the sky would be as bright as the surface of a star. However, the night sky is largely
dark.[46][47]

Since the 17th century, astronomers and other thinkers have proposed many possible ways to resolve this paradox, but the
currently accepted resolution depends in part on the Big Bang theory, and in part on the Hubble expansion: in a universe that
existed for a finite amount of time, only the light of a finite number of stars has had enough time to reach us, and the paradox is
resolved. Additionally, in an expanding universe, distant objects recede from us, which causes the light emanated from them to be
redshifted and diminished in brightness by the time we see it.[46][47]

Dimensionless Hubble constant
Instead of working with Hubble's constant, a common practice is to introduce the dimensionless Hubble constant, usually
denoted by h and commonly referred to as "little h",[31] then to write Hubble's constant H0 as h × 100 km⋅s−1

⋅Mpc−1, all the
relative uncertainty of the true value of H0 being then relegated to h.[48] The dimensionless Hubble constant is often used when

giving distances that are calculated from redshift z using the formula d ≈  c
H  × z. Since H0 is not precisely known, the distance is

0
expressed as:

In other words, one calculates 2998 × z and one gives the units as Mpc h-1 or h-1 Mpc.

Occasionally a reference value other than 100 may be chosen, in which case a subscript is presented after h to avoid confusion;
e.g. h70 denotes H0 = 70 h70 (km/s-1)/Mpc, which implies h70 = h / 0.7.

This should not be confused with the dimensionless value of Hubble's constant, usually expressed in terms of Planck units,
obtained by multiplying H0 by 1.75 × 10−63 (from definitions of parsec and tP), for example for H0 = 70, a Planck unit version
of 1.2 × 10−61 is obtained.

Acceleration of the expansion
A value for q measured from standard candle observations of Type Ia supernovae, which was determined in 1998 to be negative,
surprised many astronomers with the implication that the expansion of the universe is currently "accelerating"[49] (although the
Hubble factor is still decreasing with time, as mentioned above in the Interpretation section; see the articles on dark energy and the
ΛCDM model).

Derivation of the Hubble parameter
Start with the Friedmann equation:

where H is the Hubble parameter, a is the scale factor, G is the gravitational constant, k is the normalised spatial curvature of the
universe and equal to −1, 0, or 1, and Λ is the cosmological constant.

Matter-dominated universe (with a cosmological constant)
If the universe is matter-dominated, then the mass density of the universe ρ can be taken to include just matter so



where ρm  is the density of matter today. From the Friedmann equation and thermodynamic principles we know for non-
0

relativistic particles that their mass density decreases proportional to the inverse volume of the universe, so the equation above
must be true. We can also define (see density parameter for Ωm)

therefore:

Also, by definition,

where the subscript 0 refers to the values today, and a0 = 1. Substituting all of this into the Friedmann equation at the start of this
section and replacing a with a = 1/(1+z) gives

Matter- and dark energy-dominated universe
If the universe is both matter-dominated and dark energy-dominated, then the above equation for the Hubble parameter will also
be a function of the equation of state of dark energy. So now:

where ρde is the mass density of the dark energy. By definition, an equation of state in cosmology is P = wρc2, and if this is
substituted into the fluid equation, which describes how the mass density of the universe evolves with time, then

If w is constant, then

implying:

Therefore, for dark energy with a constant equation of state w, . If this is substituted into the Friedman
equation in a similar way as before, but this time set k = 0, which assumes a spatially flat universe, then (see shape of the
universe)



If the dark energy derives from a cosmological constant such as that introduced by Einstein, it can be shown that w = −1. The
equation then reduces to the last equation in the matter-dominated universe section, with Ωk set to zero. In that case the initial
dark energy density ρde0 is given by[50]

If dark energy does not have a constant equation-of-state w, then

and to solve this, w(a) must be parametrized, for example if w(a) = w0 + wa(1−a), giving[51]

Other ingredients have been formulated.[52][53][54]

Units derived from the Hubble constant

Hubble time
The Hubble constant H0 has units of inverse time; the Hubble time tH is simply defined as the inverse of the Hubble constant,[55]

i.e.

This is slightly different from the age of the universe, which is approximately 13.8 billion years. The Hubble time is the age it
would have had if the expansion had been linear,[56] and it is different from the real age of the universe because the expansion is
not linear; it depends on the energy content of the universe (see § Derivation of the Hubble parameter).

We currently appear to be approaching a period where the expansion of the universe is exponential due to the increasing
dominance of vacuum energy. In this regime, the Hubble parameter is constant, and the universe grows by a factor e each Hubble
time:

Likewise, the generally accepted value of 2.27 Es−1 means that (at the current rate) the universe would grow by a factor of e2.27 in
one exasecond.

Over long periods of time, the dynamics are complicated by general relativity, dark energy, inflation, etc., as explained above.

Hubble length
The Hubble length or Hubble distance is a unit of distance in cosmology, defined as cH−1 — the speed of light multiplied by the
Hubble time. It is equivalent to 4,420 million parsecs or 14.4 billion light years. (The numerical value of the Hubble length in light
years is, by definition, equal to that of the Hubble time in years.) The Hubble distance would be the distance between the Earth
and the galaxies which are currently receding from us at the speed of light, as can be seen by substituting D = cH−1 into the
equation for Hubble's law, v = H0D.

Hubble volume



The Hubble volume is sometimes defined as a volume of the universe with a comoving size of cH−1. The exact definition varies:
it is sometimes defined as the volume of a sphere with radius cH−1, or alternatively, a cube of side cH−1. Some cosmologists
even use the term Hubble volume to refer to the volume of the observable universe, although this has a radius approximately three
times larger.

Determining the Hubble constant
The value of the Hubble constant, H0, tells the rate at which the universe is expanding. In
1929, Edwin Hubble determined for the first time this constant to be 500 km/s per million
parsecs. Since then, Hubble constant has been actively measured using various methods. In
the early days, Hubble, for example, used bright stars and the light of the "nebula" to
estimate the redshift and determined the constant. Later, after type Ia supernova was found
to be a better "standard candle" of distant galaxies, supernova were used to determine the
redshift. These measurements need to determine the distance of the target stars or galaxies
first. Uncertainties in the physical assumptions used to determine these distances have
caused varying estimates of the Hubble constant.[3]

More recently, scientists use CMB measurements (such as Planck's data) to determine the
Hubble constant. The challenge of using this method is that its result varies depending on
the cosmology models used. Due to the different values of Hubble constant estimated using
different techniques, the determination of Hubble constant is an active research field
(Hubble tension). The high accuracy measurement using James Webb Space Telescope in
2023 has confirmed the earlier observation of the Hubble Space Telescope, which gave a
Hubble constant about H0 = 74 (km/s)/Mpc.[58][59]

The value of the Hubble constant in

Earlier measurement and discussion approaches (km/s)/Mpc, including measurement
uncertainty, for recent surveys[57]

Hubble's original estimate of the constant now bearing his name, based on observations of
Cepheid variable stars as "standard candles" to measure distance,[60] was 500 (km/s)/Mpc
(much larger than the value astronomers currently calculate). Later observations by astronomer Walter Baade led him to realize
that there were distinct "populations" for stars (Population I and Population II) in a galaxy. The same observations led him to
discover that there are two types of Cepheid variable stars with different luminosities. Using this discovery, he recalculated
Hubble constant and the size of the known universe, doubling the previous calculation made by Hubble in 1929.[61][62][60] He
announced this finding to considerable astonishment at the 1952 meeting of the International Astronomical Union in Rome.

For most of the second half of the 20th century, the value of H0 was estimated to be between 50 and 90 (km/s)/Mpc.

The value of the Hubble constant was the topic of a long and rather bitter controversy between Gérard de Vaucouleurs, who
claimed the value was around 100, and Allan Sandage, who claimed the value was near 50.[63] In one demonstration of vitriol
shared between the parties, when Sandage and Gustav Andreas Tammann (Sandage's research colleague) formally acknowledged
the shortcomings of confirming the systematic error of their method in 1975, Vaucouleurs responded "It is unfortunate that this
sober warning was so soon forgotten and ignored by most astronomers and textbook writers".[64] In 1996, a debate moderated by
John Bahcall between Sidney van den Bergh and Gustav Tammann was held in similar fashion to the earlier Shapley–Curtis
debate over these two competing values.

This previously wide variance in estimates was partially resolved with the introduction of the ΛCDM model of the universe in the
late 1990s. Incorporating the ΛCDM model, observations of high-redshift clusters at X-ray and microwave wavelengths using the
Sunyaev–Zel'dovich effect, measurements of anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background radiation, and optical surveys all
gave a value of around 50–70 km/s/Mpc for the constant.[65]

Hubble tension
In the 21st century, multiple methods have been used to determine the Hubble constant. "Late universe" measurements using
calibrated distance ladder techniques have converged on a value of approximately 73 (km/s)/Mpc. Since 2000, "early universe"
techniques based on measurements of the cosmic microwave background have become available, and these agree on a value near
67.7 (km/s)/Mpc.[66] (This is accounting for the change in the expansion rate since the early universe, so is comparable to the first



number.) Initially, this discrepancy was within the estimated measurement uncertainties and thus no cause for concern. However,
as techniques have improved the estimated measurement uncertainties have shrunk, but the discrepancies have not, to the point
that the disagreement is now highly statistically significant. This discrepancy is called the "Hubble tension".[67][68]

The cause of the Hubble tension is unknown,[69] and there are many possible proposed solutions. The most conservative is that
there is an unknown systematic error affecting either early-universe or late-universe observations. Although intuitively appealing,
this explanation requires multiple unrelated effects regardless of whether early-universe or late-universe observations are
incorrect, and there are no obvious candidates.[68] Furthermore, any such systematic error would need to affect multiple different
instruments, since both the early-universe and late-universe observations come from several different telescopes.[a][b]

Alternatively, it could be that the observations are correct, but some unaccounted-for effect is causing the discrepancy. If the
cosmological principle fails (see Lambda-CDM model § Violations of the cosmological principle), then the existing interpretations
of the Hubble constant and the Hubble tension have to be revised, which might resolve the Hubble tension.[71] In particular, we
would need to be located within a very large void, up to about a redshift of 0.5, for such an explanation to not be in tension with
supernovae and baryon acoustic oscillation observations.[68] Yet another possibility is that the uncertainties in the measurements
could have been underestimated.[72]

Finally, another possibility is new physics beyond the currently accepted cosmological model of the universe, the ΛCDM
model.[68][73] There are very many theories in this category, for example, replacing general relativity with a modified theory of
gravity could potentially resolve the tension,[74][75] as can a dark energy component in the early universe,[c][76] dark energy with a
time-varying equation of state,[d][77] or dark matter that decays into dark radiation.[78] A problem faced by all these theories is that
both early-universe and late-universe measurements rely on multiple independent lines of physics, and it is difficult to modify any
of those lines while preserving their successes elsewhere. The scale of the challenge can be seen from how some authors have
argued that new early-universe physics alone is not sufficient;[79][80] while other authors argue that new late-universe physics
alone is also not sufficient.[81] Nonetheless, astronomers are trying, with interest in the Hubble tension growing strongly since the
mid 2010s.[68]

21st century measurements
More recent measurements from the Planck mission published in 2018 indicate a lower value of 67.66 ± 0.42 (km/s)/Mpc,
although, even more recently, in March 2019, a higher value of 74.03 ± 1.42 (km/s)/Mpc has been determined using an improved
procedure involving the Hubble Space Telescope.[82] The two measurements disagree at the 4.4σ level, beyond a plausible level of
chance.[83] The resolution to this disagreement is an ongoing area of active research.[84]

In October 2018, scientists presented a new third way (two earlier methods, one based on redshifts and another on the cosmic
distance ladder, gave results that do not agree), using information from gravitational wave events (especially those involving the
merger of neutron stars, like GW170817), of determining the Hubble constant.[85][86]

In July 2019, astronomers reported that a new method to determine the Hubble constant, and resolve the discrepancy of earlier
methods, has been proposed based on the mergers of pairs of neutron stars, following the detection of the neutron star merger of

+5.3
GW170817, an event known as a dark siren.[87][88] Their measurement of the Hubble constant is 73.3 −5.0 (km/s)/Mpc.[89]

Also in July 2019, astronomers reported another new method, using data from the Hubble Space Telescope and based on distances
to red giant stars calculated using the tip of the red-giant branch (TRGB) distance indicator. Their measurement of the Hubble
constant is 69.8 +1.9

−1.9 (km/s)/Mpc.[90][91][92]

In February 2020, the Megamaser Cosmology Project published independent results that confirmed the distance ladder results and
differed from the early-universe results at a statistical significance level of 95%.[93] In July 2020, measurements of the cosmic
background radiation by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope predict that the Universe should be expanding more slowly than is
currently observed.[94]

In July 2023, an independent estimate of the Hubble constant was derived from the optical counterpart of a neutron-star merger, a
so-called kilonova.[95] Due to the blackbody nature of early kilonova spectra,[96] such systems provide strongly constraining
estimators of cosmic distance. Using the kilonova AT2017gfo, these measurements indicate a local-estimate of the Hubble
constant of 67.0 ± 3.6 (km/s)/Mpc.[97][95]

In August, 2024. Wendy Freedman et al. prepublished a meaurement of the Hubble constant using data from the James Webb
Space Telescope to re-measure the second rung of the cosmic distance ladder, using standard candle stars to measure the distances
to ten nearby galaxies which have hosted type Ia supernovae, the standard candle used for the third rung. They used three different



types of standard candle: tip of the red-giant
branch stars, J-region asymptotic giant branch
stars (carbon stars particularly bright in the J
band), and the traditional Cepheid variable
stars.[98][99][100] The TRGB amd JAGB
distances agreed with each other within 1%,
while the Cepheid-measured distances are a
few percent shorter, resulting in computed
Hubble constant values of 69.85 ± 2.33,
67.96 ± 2.65, and 72.05 ± 3.62 km/s/Mpc,
respectively. While not yet conclusive, this
hints at the possibility that the lower H0
values may be correct and that higher
measurements could be due to some unknown
systematic error in the measurement of
Cepheid variable stars.

SH0ES (2020) values highlighted in pink and cyan respectively.[68]

Estimated values of the Hubble constant, 2001–2020. Estimates in black represent calibrated distance ladder measurements which tend to
cluster around 73 (km/s)/Mpc; red represents early universe CMB/BAO measurements with ΛCDM parameters which show good agreement
on a figure near 67 (km/s)/Mpc, while blue are other techniques, whose uncertainties are not yet small enough to decide between the two.

Notes
a. For example, the South Pole Telescope, Atacama Cosmology Telescope and Planck (spacecraft) all provide

independent measurements of the Hubble parameter during the early universe.
b. The latest data from the James Webb Space Telescope support earlier results from the Hubble Space Telescope,

suggesting that systematic errors in Hubble's Cepheid photometry are not significant enough to cause the Hubble
tension.[70]

c. In standard ΛCDM, dark energy only comes into play in the late universe – its effect in the early universe is too
small to have an effect.

d. In standard ΛCDM, dark energy has a constant equation of state w = −1.

Wendy Freedman & Barry Madore (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkGUoKukwk8). Cosmology talks – via
YouTube. Freeman & Madore make the point that Cepheid variable stars are young stars, necessarily located
close to star-forming regions deep inside galaxies, where nearby stars complicate their observation. TRGB and
JAGB stars are old stars which have had time to migrate to the stellar halo, where their relative isolation makes
them much easier to ovserve.
