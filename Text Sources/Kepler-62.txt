Kepler-62
Kepler-62 is a K-type main sequence star cooler Kepler-62
and smaller than the Sun, located roughly 980 light-
years (300 parsecs) from Earth in the constellation
Lyra. It resides within the field of vision of the
Kepler spacecraft, the satellite that NASA's Kepler
Mission used to detect planets that may be transiting
their stars. On April 18, 2013, it was announced that
the star has five planets, two of which, Kepler-62e
and Kepler-62f are within the star's habitable
zone.[2][4] The outermost, Kepler-62f, is likely a
rocky planet.[2]

2011 data release,[2] with another two candidate planets, with orbital periods of 267.29 and 12.4417 days,
respectively, being detected in a 2012 data release by the Kepler spacecraft.[2]

The designations b, c, d, e, and f derive from the order of discovery. The designation of b is given to the
first planet orbiting a given star, followed by the other lowercase letters of the alphabet.[8] In the case of
Kepler-62, all of the known planets in the system were announced at one time, so b is applied to the
closest planet to the star and f to the farthest.[2] The name Kepler-62 derives directly from the fact that the
star is the catalogued 62nd star discovered by Kepler to have confirmed planets.

Stellar characteristics
Kepler-62 is a K-type main sequence star that is approximately 69% the mass of and 64% the radius of
the Sun. It has a temperature of 4925 K and is 7 billion years old.[2] In comparison, the Sun is about 4.6
billion years old[9] and has a temperature of 5778 K.[10]

The star is somewhat poor in metals, with a metallicity ([Fe/H]) of about –0.37, or about 42% of the
amount of iron and other heavier metals found in the Sun, which is similar to that of Kepler-442.[2] The
star's luminosity is typical for a star like Kepler-62, with a luminosity of around 21% of that of the solar
luminosity.[2]



The star's apparent magnitude, or how bright it appears from Earth's perspective, is 13.75. Therefore, it is
too dim to be seen with the naked eye.

All known planets transit the star; this means that all five planets' orbits appear to cross in front of their
star as viewed from the Earth's perspective. Their inclinations relative to Earth's line of sight, or how far
above or below the plane of sight they are, vary by less than one degree. This allows direct measurements
of the planets' periods and relative diameters (compared to the host star) by monitoring each planet's
transit of the star. The exact eccentricity of the planets are not known but estimates place it very close to
0, giving the planets a mostly circular orbit.[2]

The radii of the planets fall between 0.54 and 1.95 Earth radii. Of particular interest are the planets e and
f, as they were the best candidates for solid planets falling into the habitable zone of their star at the time
of discovery. Their radii, 1.61 and 1.41 Earth radii respectively, put them in a radius range where they
may be solid terrestrial planets. Their positions within the Kepler-62 system mean that they fall within
Kepler-62's habitable zone: the distance range where, for a given chemical composition (significant
amounts of carbon dioxide for Kepler-62f, and a protective cloud cover for Kepler-62e), these two planets
could have liquid water on their surfaces,[2] perhaps completely covering them.[11][12] The masses of the
planets could not be directly determined using either the radial velocity or the transit timing method; this
failure leads to weak upper limits for the planets' masses. For e and f, that upper limit amounts to 36 and
35 Earth masses, respectively; the real masses are expected to be significantly lower.[2] Based on
composition models, the Planetary Habitability Laboratory estimated masses for the planets of 2.1, 0.1,
5.5, 3.6, and 2.6 ME, respectively.[13] The existence of an additional planet (at a distance of 0.22 AU,



between Kepler-62e and Kepler-62f) of the Kepler-62 system was predicted, but no such planet has been
detected.[14] To keep this planetary system, which is highly sensitive to perturbations, stable, no
additional giant planets can be located within 30 AU from the parent star.[15]
