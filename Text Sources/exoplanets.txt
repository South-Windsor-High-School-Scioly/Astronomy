Astronomy/Exoplanets
Exoplanets, or extra-solar planets, are planets orbiting stars outside of Earth's solar system.
Exoplanets is one of the topics for the 2024 Astronomy event, the others being Stellar Evolution
and Star Formation.

Detection of Exoplanets
In the equations below, the subscript s denotes the star, and the subscript e denotes the exoplanet.
R denotes the radius of the object, and M denotes the mass of the object.

Transit
The transit method uses the light blocked from the parent star by the host planet to determine
various properties of the star and planet. When a planet comes across the plane of the star in the
point of view of the Earth, the light given by the star will encounter a brief dip then flatten out before
then coming back up to the mean value. This dip, called the transit depth, can be used to calculate
the radius of the planet by comparing it with the radius of the star which can be determined through
other means and the equation

where ΔF is the change in flux or brightness of the star, and F 0 is the original flux.
One important factor is the likelihood of transit in terms of the properties of the star. This also
determines how likely it is to find a certain kind of exoplanet. The bigger the planet, the more likely
the transit can happen which should make sense: the bigger the planet, the more area it covers in
the sky and more importantly on the star itself, increasing the likelihood of a transit. The bigger the
orbit, the less likely the transit can happen due to the inclination of the orbit. With a smaller orbital
radius, there exists a greater range of inclinations that can result in a transit regardless of the size of
the planet. However, with a larger orbital radius, there exists a lower range of inclination possibly
resulting in a transit.
As of September 2023, the transit method has discovered the largest number of exoplanets (about
3/4 of the total known exoplanets), particularly due to the Kepler/K2 and TESS (Transiting Exoplanet
Survey Satellite) missions.

Radial Velocity
Radial velocity, also known as Doppler spectroscopy, detects exoplanets by measuring Doppler
shifts in the spectrum of the parent star. As of September 2023, about 19% of exoplanets were
detected using radial velocity.
The velocity and period of the planet's orbit and the mass of the planet can be calculated after
measurements with Radial Velocity. First, if the mass of the star M s is not given, calculate it by
plotting it on the H-R diagram. If the velocity of the star is not given, calculate it using the Doppler
shift formula

Δλ
v
= , where λ 0 is the average of the highest and lowest wavelength and Δλ is the

difference between the highest and the average wavelengths.

Find the period P of the star's orbit from the radial velocity measurements. Then, use the general

GM s
form 2 =
of Kepler's Third Law, where r is the length of the semi-major axis of the planet's
P

orbit. Alternatively, one can use the specific form 2 = M s where r is in AU, P is in years and M s is
P
in solar masses.

Find the velocity of the planet using v p =

. Finally, find the mass of the planet using
P

This calculation gives us the minimum mass of the planet. The measured velocity of the star is less
than its true velocity if the orbital plane is not perpendicular to the sky.Let α denote the orbital
inclination (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_inclination#Exoplanets_and_multiple_star_systems),
then the true velocity of the star and true mass of the planet is given by

When an exoplanet transits the parent star, the inclination α is very close to 90 degrees. Therefore,

the calculation based on radial velocity is close to its true mass.

Direct Imaging
Direct imaging detects exoplanets by resolving the
exoplanet from the star in an image. is usually very difficult,
because planets are much fainter than their parent stars. The
coronoagraph is used to block the light from the star so the
planets can be resolved. Most direct imaged exoplanets are
relatively close to the Earth, widely separated from its parent
star, and are especially large and hot. Images are made in
the infrared, where the radiation from the planet is the
strongest.

Types of Exoplanets
Gas Giant

Direct Image of four planets around the
star HR 8799.

Planets composed mainly of hydrogen and helium. They may
possibly have rocky or icy cores. They have masses greater
than 10 Earth masses.

Hot Jupiters
Gas giants that orbit very close to their host star. Scientists believed Hot Jupiters formed farther
away and migrated inward. Migration is a change in orbit due to interactions with a disk of gas or
planetesimals. Hot Jupiters are found within .05-.5 AU of the host star. They are extremely hot, with
temperatures as high as 2400 K. They were initially the most common type of exoplanet found
because they are the easiest to detect (because they are huge and close to the host star), but as
detection methods have improved smaller exoplanets and exoplanets farther from their host stars
have been discovered as well.

Ice Giant
Composed primarily of volatile substances heavier than helium, such as oxygen, carbon, nitrogen,
and sulfur. Ice giants have significantly less helium and hydrogen than gas giants and they are also
smaller. Uranus and Neptune are ice giants. According to some planetary models, these two giant
planets may have layers of superionic ice under relatively shallow hydrogen and helium atmospheres,
which would explain their unusual magnetic fields.

Terrestrial Planet
Composed primarily of silicate minerals or metals.

Super-Earth
Defined exclusively by mass with upper and lower limits. Super Earths are ‘potentially’ rocky planets
with up to 10 times the mass of Earth. The term ‘Super Earth’ simply refers to the mass of the planet
and not to any planetary conditions, so some of these may actually be gas dwarfs. The Kepler
Mission defined a Super-Earth as a planet bigger than Earth-like planets (.8-1.25 Earth radii), but
smaller than mini-Neptunes (2-4 Earth radii).

Mini-Neptune
Also known as a gas dwarf or transitional planet. Mini-Neptunes are planets with a mass up to 10
Earth masses. They are less massive than Uranus and Neptune (shocker) and have thick
hydrogen/helium atmospheres.

Pulsar Planet
A planet that orbits a pulsar, a rapidly rotating neutron star. Pulsar planets are discovered through
anomalies in pulsar timing measurements. Pulsars rotate at a regular speed, so any bodies orbiting
the pulsar will cause regular changes in its pulsation. The changes can be detected with precise
timing measurements.

Goldilocks Planet
Planet that falls within star's habitable zone, which basically means it has the potential to support
liquid water on its surface.

Rogue Planet
Also known as interstellar planet, nomad planet, free-floating planet, orphan planet, wandering
planet or starless planet. A planet without a host star that orbits the galaxy directly.

Puffy Planet
A planet with a large radius but very low density. Puffy planets expand because they are being
warmed from the inside out. This warming may be from the star's heat reaches the planet's core, or
from stellar winds carrying ions and heat that reach deeper into the planet. The ions are attracted to
the planet's magnetic field. Friction is generated by winds blowing past ions being held by the
magnetic field, creating heat that will warm the planet from the inside and causing it to expand.

Chthonian Planet
The rocky core left behind when a hot Jupiter orbits too close to their star. The star's heat and
extreme gravity can rip away the planet's water or atmosphere.

Water Worlds
An exoplanet completely covered in water. Simulations suggest that these planets formed from icerich debris further from their host star. As they migrated inward, the water melted and covered the
planet in a giant ocean.

Temperature of Exoplanets
In calculation of temperature of exoplanets, the star is often assumed to be a blackbody. The
exoplanet is assumed to reflect some of the radiation, have no heating from its core, and have
emissivity close to 1.
Let the temperature of the exoplanet and the star be T e and T s , and the radius be R e and R s . They
are separated by a distance of D. Then, by Stefan-Boltzmann Law, the radiation from the star and
the exoplanet is

L s = 4πR 2s ⋅ σT s4 ,

L e = 4πR 2e ⋅ σT e4 ,

where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.
Only a fraction of the star's radiation reaches the exoplanet, and only a fraction of those radiation is

πR 2e
absorbed. The ratio of radiation that reaches the exoplanet is
by considering the sphere
4πD 2
centered at the sun that crosses the exoplanet, and 1 − A of those is absorbed, where A is the
πR 2e (1 − A)
Albedo (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albedo) of the planet. Therefore, L e =
Ls .

This equation can also be adjusted to account for the presence of an atmosphere with greenhouse
gases, which gives a better prediction of temperature for some types of exoplanets.
