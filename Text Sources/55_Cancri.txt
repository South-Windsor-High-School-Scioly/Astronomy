55 Cancri
55 Cancri is a binary star system located 41[1] light- 55 Cancri
years away from the Sun in the zodiac constellation of
Cancer. It has the Bayer designation Rho1 Cancri
(ρ1 Cancri); 55 Cancri is the Flamsteed designation
(abbreviated 55 Cnc). The system consists of a K-type
star (designated 55 Cancri A, also named Copernicus
/koʊˈpɜːrnɪkəs/)[13] and a smaller red dwarf (55
Cancri B).

As of 2015, five extrasolar planets (designated 55
Cancri b, c, d, e and f; named Galileo, Brahe,
Lipperhey, Janssen and Harriot, respectively) are
known to orbit 55 Cancri A.

55 Cancri is the system's Flamsteed designation. It Constellation Cancer

also bears the Bayer designation ρ1 Cancri (Latinised Pronunciation /ˈkæŋkraɪ/ or /ˈkæŋkriː/
to Rho1 Cancri) and the Bright Star Catalogue 55 Cancri A
designation HR 3522. The two components are Right ascension 08h 52m 35.8111s[1]

designated A and B,[14] though component A is Declination +28° 19′ 50.955″[1]
sometimes referred to simply as 55 Cancri.[15] The
first planet discovered orbiting 55 Cancri A was Apparent magnitude (V) 5.95[2]

is more commonly referred to as 55 Cancri b.[17] Right ascension 08h 52m 40.8627s[3]

Under the rules for naming objects in binary star Declination +28° 19′ 58.821″[3]

systems it should be named 55 Cancri Ab[18] and this Apparent magnitude (V) 13.15[4]
more formal form is occasionally used to avoid
confusion with the secondary star 55 Cancri B. The Characteristics

other planets discovered were designated 55 Cancri c, 55 Cancri A

billion years.[10]

A hypothesis for the high metal content in SMR dwarf stars is that material enriched in heavy elements fell into the
atmosphere from a protoplanetary disk. This would pollute the star's external layers, resulting in a higher than normal
metallicity. The lack of a deep convection zone would mean that the outer layers would retain higher abundance
ratios of these heavy elements.[29]

Observations of 55 Cancri A in the submillimeter region of the spectrum have thus far failed to detect any associated
dust. The upper limit on emissions within 100 AU of this star is about 850 mJy, at a wavelength of 850 μm. This
limits the total mass of fine dust around the star to less than 0.01% of the Earth's mass. However, this does not
exclude the presence of an asteroid belt or a Kuiper belt equivalent.[30]

55 Cancri B
The secondary, 55 Cancri B, is a red dwarf star much less massive and luminous than the Sun. There are indications
that component B may itself be a double star, though this is uncertain.[14]

The 55 Cancri system was the first known to have four, and later five, planets, and may possibly have more. The
innermost planet, e, transits 55 Cancri A as viewed from Earth.[31] The next planet, b, is non-transiting but there is
tentative evidence that it is surrounded by an extended atmosphere that does transit the star.[26]

In 1997, the discovery of a 51 Pegasi-like planet orbiting 55 Cancri A was announced, together with the planet of Tau
Boötis and the inner planet of Upsilon Andromedae.[16] The planet was discovered by measuring the star's radial
velocity, which showed a periodicity of around 14.7 days corresponding to a planet at least 78% of the mass of
Jupiter. These radial velocity measurements still showed a drift unaccounted for by this planet, which could be
explained by the gravitational influence of a more distant object.



In 1998 the discovery of a possible dust disk around 55 Cancri A was
announced.[34] Calculations gave the disk radius at least 40 AU, similar to the
Kuiper belt in the Solar System, with an inclination of 25° with respect to the
plane of the sky. However, the discovery could not be verified and was later
deemed to be spurious, caused instead by background galaxies.[35]

After making further radial velocity measurements, a planet orbiting at a
distance of around 5 AU was announced in 2002.[15] This planet received the
designation 55 Cancri d. At the time of discovery, the planet was thought to be
in an orbit of mild eccentricity (close to 0.1), but this value was increased by
later measurements. Even after accounting for these two planets, a periodicity
at 43 days remained, possibly due to a third planet. Measurements of the star Comparison of the orbits of the inner
suggested that this was close to the star's rotation period, which raised the planets of 55 Cancri A (black) with
possibility that the 43-day signal was caused by stellar activity. This possible the planets of the Solar System
planet received the designation 55 Cancri c.

55 Cancri e was announced in 2004.[36]

With 8.3 Earth masses, it is a large
super-Earth which was originally
thought to have an orbital period of 2.8
days, though it was later found that this
was an alias of its true period of 0.74 of

Artist's rendition of 55 Cnc's planets a day by observations of e transiting in
2011.[31] This planet was the first The Solar System with only Earth
known instance of a fourth extrasolar and Jupiter compared with the

planet in one system, and was the shortest-period planet until the discovery of planetary system of 55 Cancri
PSR J1719−1438 b. The measurements that led to the discovery of this planet (Note: this depiction was made

also confirmed the existence of 55 Cancri c. before planets e and f were
discovered.)

In 2005, Jack Wisdom combined three data sets and drew two distinct
conclusions: that the 2.8-day planet was an alias and that there was a Neptune-
scale planet with a period near 261 days. Fischer et al. (2008)[37] reported new observations that they said confirmed
the existence of the 2.8-day planet, as first reported by McArthur et al. (2004), and a 260-day Neptune-sized planet,
as first reported by Wisdom (2005).[38] However, Dawson and Fabrycky (2010)[32] concluded that the 2.8-day planet
was indeed an alias, as suggested by Wisdom (2005), and that the correct period was 0.7365 of a day.

In 2007, Fisher et al. confirmed the existence of the 260-day planet proposed in 2005 by Wisdom. This planet, 55
Cancri f, was the first occurrence of a fifth extrasolar planet in one system. With a similar mass to c, it has a 260-day
orbit, towards the inner edge of 55 Cancri A's habitable zone.[39][40] The planet itself is not thought to be conducive
to life, but hypothetical moons in principle could maintain at least water and life.

The planet e's eccentricity is poorly defined; varying values between 0 and 0.4 does not significantly improve the fit,
so an eccentricity of 0.2 was assumed. Taking interactions between the planets into account results in a near-zero
orbital eccentricity.

Astrometric observations with the Hubble Space Telescope measured an inclination of 53° of the outer planet d,[36]

though this result relies on the precise orbital parameters which have been substantially revised since this was
published.[41] The observed transits of e suggest an orbit normal inclined within 9° to the line-of-sight, and a possible
detection of the transit of an extended atmosphere around 55 Cancri b would, if confirmed, imply that it too is in an
orbit that is close to edge-on.[26] Between them, no measurement of c's nor f's inclinations have been made. It had
been thought that with five planets, the system cannot deviate far from coplanar in order to maintain stability.[40] An



attempt to measure the spin-orbit misalignment of the innermost planet reported that it was in a nearly polar orbit,[42]

but this interpretation of the data has since been challenged by a subsequent study, with noted inconsistencies
between the implied and measured stellar rotation.[43]

The approximate ratios of periods of adjacent orbits are (proceeding outward): 1:20, 1:3, 1:6, 1:20. The nearly 1:3
ratio between 55 Cancri b and c is apparently a near resonance, rather than a genuine mean motion resonance.[40]

Possible additional planets
Between planets f and d, there appears to be a huge gap of distance where no planets are known to orbit. A 2008
paper found that as many as 3 additional planets of up to 50 times the mass of Earth could orbit at a distance of 0.9 to
3.8 AU from the star, and stable resonances of a hypothetical planet g with the known planets were found to be 3f:2g,
2g:1d, and 3g:2d.[44] A study released in 2019 showed that undiscovered terrestrial planets may be able to orbit safely
in this region at 1 to 2 AU; this space includes the outer limits of 55 Cancri's habitable Zone.[45] In 2021, it was found
that terrestrial planets with comparable water content to Earth may have indeed been able to form and survive
between the planets f and d.[46] As for the space outside d's orbit, its stability zone begins beyond 10 AU, though
there is a stability zone between 8.6 and 9 AU due to a 2:1 resonance.[44]

Search for Radio Emissions
Since 55 Cancri e orbits less than 0.1 AU from its host star, some scientists hypothesized that it may cause stellar
flaring synchronized to the orbital period of the exoplanet. A 2011 search for these magnetic star-planet interactions
that would result in coronal radio emissions resulted in no detected signal. Furthermore, no magnetospheric radio
emissions were detected from any exoplanet within the system.[47]

Communication
A METI message was sent to 55 Cancri. It was transmitted from Eurasia's largest radar—the 70 m (230 ft) Evpatoria
Planetary Radar. The message was named Cosmic Call 2; it was sent on July 6, 2003, and it will arrive at 55 Cancri
in May 2044.[48]
