GJ 1214 b
GJ 1214 b (sometimes Gliese 1214 b,[6] also named GJ 1214 b / Enaiposha
Enaiposha since 2023[2]) is an exoplanet that orbits
the star GJ 1214, and was discovered in
December 2009. Its parent star is 48 light-years from
the Sun, in the constellation Ophiuchus. As of 2017,
GJ 1214 b is the most likely known candidate for being
an ocean planet.[1][7] For that reason, scientists often
call the planet a "waterworld".[8]

spectral lines due to the Doppler effect,[1] yielding a mass of

can be calculated. Through a comparison with theoretical models,
the density in turn provides limited but highly useful information
about the composition and structure of the planet.[1]

Atmosphere
Due to the relatively small size of GJ 1214 b's parent star, it is
feasible to perform spectroscopic observations during planetary
transits. By comparing the observed spectrum before and during
transits, the spectrum of the planetary atmosphere can be inferred.
In December 2010, a study was published showing the spectrum
to be largely featureless over the wavelength range of 750–

may be a thick layer of high clouds, which absorbs the
starlight.[17] Because of the estimated old age of the planetary system and the calculated hydrodynamic
escape (loss of gasses that tends to deplete an atmosphere of higher molecular-weight constituents) rate of
900 tonnes per second, scientists conclude that there has been a significant atmospheric loss during the
lifetime of the planet and any current atmosphere cannot be primordial.[1] The loss of primordial
atmosphere was indirectly confirmed in 2020 as no helium was detected at GJ 1214 b.[18] Helium was
detected in the atmosphere of GJ 1214 b by 2022 though.[19]

Possible compositions



While very little is known about GJ 1214 b, there has been speculation as to its specific nature and
composition. On the basis of planetary models[20] it has been suggested that GJ 1214 b has a relatively
thick gaseous envelope,[9] totaling about 5% of planetary mass.[3] It is possible to propose structures by
assuming different compositions, guided by scenarios for the formation and evolution of the planet.[9]

GJ 1214 b could be a rocky planet with an outgassed hydrogen-rich atmosphere, a mini-Neptune, or an
ocean planet.[9] If it is a waterworld, it could possibly be thought of as a bigger and hotter version of
Jupiter's Galilean moon Europa.[9] While no scientist has stated to believe GJ 1214 b is an ocean planet, if
GJ 1214 b is assumed to be an ocean planet,[20] i.e. the interior is assumed to be composed primarily of a
water core surrounded by more water, proportions of the total mass consistent with the mass and radius
are about 25% rock and 75% water, covered by a thick envelope of gases such as hydrogen and helium
(c. 0.05%).[1][16] Water planets could result from inward planetary migration and originate as protoplanets
that formed from volatile ice-rich material beyond the snow-line but that never attained masses sufficient
to accrete large amounts of H/He nebular gas.[9] Because of the varying pressure at depth, models of a
water world include "steam, liquid, superfluid, high-pressure ices, and plasma phases" of water.[9] Some
of the solid-phase water could be in the form of ice VII.[16]

Discovery
GJ 1214 b was first detected by the MEarth Project, which searches for the small drops in brightness that
can occur when an orbiting planet briefly passes in front of its parent star. In early 2009, the astronomers
running the project noticed that the star GJ 1214 appeared to show drops in brightness of that sort. They
then observed the star more closely and confirmed that it dimmed by roughly 1.5% every 1.58 days.
Follow-up radial-velocity measurements were then made with the HARPS spectrograph on the ESO's
3.6-meter telescope at La Silla, Chile; those measurements succeeded in providing independent evidence
for the reality of the planet. A paper was then published in Nature announcing the planet and giving
estimates of its mass, radius, and orbital parameters.[1]
