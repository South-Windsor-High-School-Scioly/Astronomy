K2-18b
K2-18b, also known as EPIC 201912552 b, is an K2-18b
exoplanet orbiting the red dwarf K2-18, located 124
light-years (38 pc) away from Earth. The planet is a
sub-Neptune about 2.6 times the radius of Earth, with a
33-day orbit within the star's habitable zone. This
means it receives about a similar amount of starlight as
the Earth receives from the Sun. Initially discovered
with the Kepler space telescope, it was later observed
by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in order
to study the planet's atmosphere.

has an additional planet inside of K2-18b's orbit, K2-
18c,[11] which may interact with K2-18b through tides.[b][13]



It is estimated that up to 80% of all M dwarf stars have planets in their habitable zones,[5] including the
stars LHS 1140, Proxima Centauri and TRAPPIST-1. The small mass, size and low temperatures of these
stars and frequent orbits of the planets make it easier to characterize the planets. On the other hand, the
low luminosity of the stars can make spectroscopic analysis of planets difficult,[14][5] and the stars are
frequently active with flares and inhomogeneous stellar surfaces (faculae and starspots), which can
produce erroneous spectral signals when investigating a planet.[9]

Physical properties
K2-18b has a radius of 2.610 ± 0.087 R🜨, a mass of 8.63 ± 1.35 ME, and orbits its star in 33 days.[5] From
Earth, it can be seen passing in front of the star.[15] The planet is most likely tidally locked to the star,
although considering its orbital eccentricity, a spin-orbit resonance like Mercury is also possible.[16]

+0.52
The density of K2-18b is about 2.67 −0.47 g/cm3 – intermediate between Earth and Neptune – implying
that the planet has a hydrogen-rich envelope.[c][14] The planet may either be rocky with a thick envelope
or have a Neptune-like composition.[d][18] A pure water planet with a thin atmosphere is less likely.[19]

Planets with radii of about 1.5–2 R🜨 are unexpectedly rare relative to their expected occurrence rate, a
phenomenon known as the radius valley. Presumably, planets with intermediary radii cannot hold their
atmospheres against the tendency of their own energy output and the stellar radiation to drive
atmospheric escape.[20] Planets with even smaller radii are known as Super-Earths and those with larger
radii as Sub-Neptunes.[21]

The planet may have taken a few million years to form.[22][23] Tidal heating is unlikely.[11] Internal
heating may increase temperatures at large depths, but is unlikely to significantly affect the surface
temperature.[23] If an ocean exists, it is probably underlaid by a high-pressure ice layer on top of a rocky
core,[24] which might destabilize the planet's climate by preventing material flows between the core and
the ocean.[25]

Possible ocean
At temperatures exceeding the critical point, liquids and gases stop being different phases and there is no
longer a separation between an ocean and the atmosphere.[26] It is unclear whether observations imply
that a separate liquid ocean exists on K2-18b,[2] and detecting such an ocean is difficult from the
outside;[27] its existence cannot be inferred or ruled out solely from the mass and radius of a planet.[28]

The existence of a liquid water ocean is uncertain.[29] Before the James Webb Space Telescope
observations, a supercritical state of the water was believed to be more likely.[30] JWST observations
were initially considered to be more consistent with a fluid-gas interface and thus a liquid ocean[31] -
trace gases such as hydrocarbons and ammonia can be lost from an atmosphere to an ocean if it exists;
their presence may thus imply the absence of an ocean-atmosphere separation.[32] However, a subsequent
work finds that a magma ocean is also capable of dissolving ammonia and explaining the observation



results,[33] while another paper suggests that a gas-rich mini-Neptune model is capable of replicating the
observed amount of methane and carbon dioxide, while a liquid water ocean model requires the presence
of a biosphere in order to produce sufficient amount of methane.[34]

Atmosphere and climate
Observations with the Hubble Space Telescope have found that K2-18b has an atmosphere consisting of
hydrogen.[35] The presence of water vapour is likely[36] but with uncertainty,[37] as James Webb Space
Telescope observations indicating concentrations of less than 0.1%;[38] this may be due to the JWST
seeing a dry stratosphere.[31] Ammonia concentrations appear to be unmeasurably low.[e][35] JWST
observations indicate that methane and carbon dioxide make up about 1% of the atmosphere.[41] Other
carbon oxides were not reported;[42] only an upper limit to their concentrations (a few percent) has been
established.[43] The atmosphere makes up at most 6.2% of the planet's mass,[18] and its composition
probably resembles that of Uranus and Neptune.[44]

There is little evidence of hazes in the atmosphere,[45] while evidence for water clouds, the only kind of
clouds likely to form at K2-18b,[46] is conflicting.[47] If they exist, the clouds are most likely icy but
liquid water is possible.[48] Apart from water, ammonium chloride, sodium sulfide, potassium chloride
and zinc sulfide could form clouds in the atmosphere of K2-18b, depending on the planet's properties.[49]

Most computer models expect that a temperature inversion will form at high elevation, yielding a
stratosphere.[50]

Evolution
High-energy radiation from the star, such as hard[f] UV radiation and X-rays, is expected to heat the
upper atmosphere and fill it with hydrogen formed through the photodissociation of water, thus forming
an extended hydrogen-rich exosphere[53] that can escape from the planet.[7] The X-ray and UV fluxes that
K2-18b receives from K2-18 are considerably higher than the equivalent fluxes from the Sun;[7] the hard

+400
UV radiation flux provides enough energy to drive this exosphere to escape at a rate of about 350 −290
tons per second, too slow to remove the planet's atmosphere during its lifespan.[54] Observations of
decreases of Lyman alpha radiation emissions during transits of the planet may show the presence of such
an exosphere; this discovery requires confirmation.[55]

Alternative scenarios
Detecting atmospheres around planets is difficult, and several reported findings are controversial.[56]

Barclay et al. 2021 suggested that the water vapour signal may be due to stellar activity, rather than water
in K2-18b's atmosphere.[3] Bézard et al. 2020 proposed that methane may be a more significant
component, making up about 3–10% while water may constitute about 5–11% of the atmosphere,[47] and
Bézard, Charnay and Blain 2022 proposed that the evidence of water is actually due to methane,[57]

although such a scenario is less probable.[58]

Models



Climate models have been used to simulate the climate that K2-18b might have, and an intercomparison
of their results for K2-18b is part of the CAMEMBERT project to simulate the climates of sub-Neptune
planets.[59] Among the climate modelling efforts made on K2-18b are:

Charnay et al. 2021, assuming that the planet is tidally locked, found an atmosphere with
weak temperature gradients and a wind system with descending air on the night side and
ascending air on the day side. In the upper atmosphere, radiation absorption by methane
produced an inversion layer.[60] Clouds could only form if the atmosphere had a high
metallicity; their properties strongly depended on the size of cloud particles and the
composition and circulation of the atmosphere. They formed mainly at the substellar point
and the terminator. If there was rainfall, it could not reach the surface; instead it evaporated
to form virga.[61] Simulations with a spin-orbit resonance did not substantially alter the cloud
distribution.[62] They also simulated the appearance of the atmosphere during stellar
transits.[63]

Innes and Pierrehumbert 2022 conducted simulations assuming different rotation rates and
concluded that except for high rotation rates, there is not a substantial temperature gradient
between poles and equator.[64] They found the existence of jet streams above the equator
and at high latitudes, with weaker equatorial jets at the surface.[65]

Hu 2021 conducted simulations of the planet's chemistry.[46] They concluded that the
photochemistry should not be able to completely remove ammonia from the outer
atmosphere[66] and that carbon oxides and cyanide would form in the middle atmosphere,
where they could be detectable.[67] The model predicts that a sulfur haze layer could form,
extending through and above the water clouds. Such a haze layer would make
investigations of the planet's atmosphere much more difficult.[68]

Tsai et al. 2024 ran chemical and physical models.[69] They found a prograde jet stream in
the troposphere and a retrograde one above 0.0001 bar altitude, with thermally-driven
circulation in-between the two.[70] They found that for dimethyl sulfide to be detectable, its
production needs to exceed Earth's by a factor of 20,[71] a rate not impossible for a plausible
ecosystem.[72] Several hydrocarbons can mask the dimethyl sulfide signal.[73]

Habitability
+114

Incoming stellar radiation amounts to 1368 −107 W/m2, similar to the average insolation Earth receives.[5]

K2-18b is located within or just slightly inside the habitable zone of its star,[74] – it may be close to[75]

but fall short of the runaway greenhouse threshold[76] – and its equilibrium temperature is about 250 K
(−23 °C; −10 °F) to 300 K (27 °C; 80 °F).[14] Whether the planet is actually habitable depends on the
nature of the envelope[30] and the albedo of clouds;[69] the deeper layers of the atmosphere may be too
hot,[40] while the water-containing layers might[25] or might not have temperatures and pressures suitable
for the development of life.[77]



Microorganisms from Earth can survive in hydrogen-rich atmospheres, illustrating that hydrogen is no
impediment to life. However, a number of biosignature gases used to identify the presence of life are not
reliable indicators when found in a hydrogen-rich atmosphere, thus different markers would be needed to
identify biological activity at K2-18b.[78] According to Madhusudhan et al., several of these markers
could be detected by the James Webb Space Telescope after a reasonable number of observations.[79]

Discovery and research history
The planet was discovered in 2015 by the Kepler space telescope,[80][81][82] and its existence was later
confirmed with the Spitzer Space Telescope and through Doppler velocity techniques.[53] Analyses of the
transits ruled out that they were caused by unseen companion stars,[82] by multiple planets or systematic
errors of the observations.[83] Early estimates of the star's radius had substantial errors, which led to
incorrect planet radius estimates and the density of the planet being overestimated.[84] The discovery of
the spectroscopic signature of water vapour on K2-18b in 2019 was the first discovery of water vapour on
an exoplanet that is not a Hot Jupiter[7] and drew a lot of discussion.[27]

K2-18b has been used as a test case for exoplanet studies.[46] The properties of K2-18b have led to the
definition of a "hycean planet", a type of planet that has both abundant liquid water and a hydrogen
envelope. Planets with such compositions were previously thought to be too hot to be habitable; findings
at K2-18b instead suggest that they might be cold enough to harbour liquid water oceans conducive to
life. The strong greenhouse effect of the hydrogen envelope might allow them to remain habitable even at
low instellation rates.[85] K2-18b is probably the best known "hycean" planet.[86] Other, non-hycean
compositions are possible, both habitable and uninhabitable.[87][69]

There is some evidence of dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and methyl
chloride being present in the atmosphere. The presence of DMS is
a potential biosignature, as the bulk of the DMS in Earth's
atmosphere is emitted from phytoplankton in marine
environments,[88] although further observation to confirm the
presence of DMS and rule out a geological or chemical origin for
the compound is required.[89][90] Some scientists have voiced

environment different than Earth.[91] In 2024, Wogan et al. Olmstead, N. Madhusudhan
suggested that the high methane concentrations might either imply
the presence of methanogenic life[92] or upwards mixing of gases
from the deep interior, if the planet is too hot for life.[93]

A podcast on the Planetary Society's website in January 2024 featured NASA astrophysicist Knicole
Colón describing some of the scientific results from the observations of K2-18b by JWST. Data from
JWST's MIRI instrument was expected to be gathered in January 2024 about which Colón said: "MIRI
will be able to see additional features, absorption features from these molecules, and validate again, the



presence of what we've seen and even the abundance." Colón also talks about the lack of evidence of
water in the atmosphere: "The fact that the JWST data basically didn't find strong evidence of water in
the atmosphere, that could indicate a couple things".[94]

Notes
a. Observations of transiting planets rely on comparing the appearance of the planet with the

appearance of the star's surface that is not covered with the planet, so variations in the
star's appearance can be confused with the effects of the planet.[9]

b. Tidal interactions are mutual interactions, mediated by gravity, between astronomical bodies
that are in motion with respect of each other.[12]

c. An envelope is an atmosphere that originated together with the planet itself from a
protoplanetary disk. In gas giants, atmospheres make up the bulk of the planet's mass.[17]

d. A Neptune-like composition implies that apart from water and rock the planet contains
substantial amounts of hydrogen and helium.[18]

e. The lack of ammonia and methane in Neptune-like exoplanet atmospheres is known as the
"missing methane problem", and is an unresolved mystery as of 2021.[39] The unusually low
ammonia and methane concentrations could be due to life, photochemical processes[30] or
the freezing-out of methane.[40]

f. Hard UV radiation means UV radiation with short wavelengths;[51] shorter wavelengths
imply a higher frequency and higher energy per photon.[52]
