Spectra of the T Tauri Stars

Frederick M. Walter



“We had the sky up there, all speckled with
stars, and we used to lay on our backs and look
up at them, and discuss about whether they
was made or only just happened. Jim he
allowed they was made, but I allowed they
happened; I judged it would have took too long
to make so many. Jim said the moon could 'a'
laid them; well, that looked kind of reasonable,
so I didn't say nothing against it, because I've
seen a frog lay most as many, so of course, it
could be done.”

The Stars of Joy

A.H. Joy, 1942, PASP, 54, 15












Some Context



Taxonomy. I.
• Continuum Stars

– Very strong Line Emission
– No photospheric absorption

• Classical T Tauri Stars (cTTS)
– Strong Line Emission
– Photospheric absorption lines, often weak

• Naked or Weak T Tauri Stars (nTTS, wTTS)
– Emission lines of chromospheric strength
– Essentially normal absorption spectra



Taxonomy. II.
Based on  = d(logF)/d(log),
               2µm<<25µm (Lada 1987)

• Class 1:  0 <  <  3, 80K < Tbol < 650K
• Class 2: -2 <  <  0   = cTTS
• Class 3: -3 <  < -2   = nTTS
• FSS:   -0.3 <  < 0.3  encompass class 1,2

• Class 0 (André et al. 2000)
– Tbol < 80K
– Lsmm/Lbol > 0.005



Spectral Energy Distributions

Class 2 Class 2

Bertout, Basri & Bouvier 1988



Birthline
• Protostar structure set by mass

accretion rate from opaque envelope
• Tcore reaches 106 K; D-burning initiated
• Deuterium acts as a thermostat
• R~M until 2D depleted
• Quasi-static contraction starts

(Stahler 1983, 1988; Palla & Stahler 1993)



Palla & Stahler, 1993, ApJ, 418, 414



The Hayashi Track
• Luminosity driven by gravitational contraction

(Kelvin-Kelmholtz)
• Envelope is fully convective
• Temperature almost independent of

luminosity due to H- opacity
• Nearly vertical evolution in H-R diagram
• When Tcore reaches ~107K, H-burning

initiated; radiative core forms and contraction
halts (Henyey track).



Taxonomy. III.
• Class 0 and 1 protostars: pre-birthline
• Continuum stars: close to the birthline?
• Class 2 stars (cTTS): on the Hayashi

track
• Class 3 stars can be on the Hayashi or

Henyey tracks, or on the ZAMS

Accretion

Channeled by magnetic funnels from the Keplerian co-
rotation radius



Consequences of Accretion
• Free-fall velocities to ~300 km/s
• Emission wings if seen off star
• Inverse P Cygni profiles if projected on

star
• Surface shock (T up to 106 K)
• Shock continuum modelled as ~8000K

slab



S CrA
• 1.3 arcsec pair

(~170 AU)
• No change in

PA in 70 years

S CrA SE Model



Accretion Continuum
• UV excess ~8-10 x103 K BB with 2% ff.
• Luminosity consistent with GM/R dm/dt
• Modeled as an optically thick slab.
• Formerly called the Boundary Layer

• Accretion cannot explain the 107K
corona.



Veiling
• The photospheric absorption lines often

appear weak
• Canonical interpretation: dilution by the

accretion continuum (e.g., Basri & Bathala 1990)

• Veiling factor VF = facc/fph
• VF up to 10 observed
• Predicts strong correlation between VF

and magnitude

Dashed curves: constant emission flux, variable continuum.
Gahm et al. 2008, A&A 482, L35



Variable Veiling in S CrA SE

[O I] is circumstellar. That it remains constant indicates that the
continuum does not change as the veiling increases



Explaining Veiling
• VF<2: enhanced accretion continuum
• VF>2: lines are diluted without an

increase in the continuum
• Line filling-in is observed
• “chromospheric” emission RVs are in

anti-phase with the absorption lines
• Electron-scattering?



Winds
• All T Tauri stars have winds
• Seen as P Cygni line

profiles
• Wind velocity
   from extent of
   optically-thick
   trough
• In this case,
   Vw ~ 380 km/s

Class 3 Stars
• From a spectroscopic viewpoint, they

are fairly normal
• Little or no accretion
• No H2 seen
• Narrow chromospheric lines
• FX/Fbol ~ 10-3



Comparison of 2 wTTS
• RECX-1 (red dashed line) shows

no evidence of accretion.
   W(H)=1.3Å
• RECX-11 (solid black line) is a

wTTS.
   W(H)=4Å.
   Note the IPC absorption
• Both stars are K5-6 members of

the  Cha SFR

Caution: this is not a reliable indicator of accretion.



Lithium
• The main photospheric “anomaly” is the

strong Li I absorption line at 6707 Å
• The line strength is consistent with

log(NLi)~3.4
• This line persists even in strongly veiled

systems
• Li is an age indicator because it fuses at

temperatures that exist at the base of the
convective zone.
